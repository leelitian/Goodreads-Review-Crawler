1`4`"Yes and perhaps sex is the nature of humanity. I mean, it is in humanity's nature to chase after sex, until taken whole the one and the other are of equal importance. An analogy may convince: you are what you eat. Till work pulps the human creature into a grubby heap. A melted snowman. Till, marked with the weals of his origins, he no longer even has his hole to retreat into. How long it takes, till humanity has finally been questioned and learns the truth about itself . . . "- I never knew there were so many different ways to talk about genitalia and sex. The language in this book is raw and honest. There's no holding back in this book and that's why it's so interesting.The notions of desire, lust, and sex are explored in this book in a way thats enthralling and thought provoking. I'm a big fan of books that portray human nature or some aspect of it openly and honestly-and that's what this book does. There were parts of this book that made me cringe, it got a bit heavy, and too raw. However I found the play on words in this book to be funny at times and very creative. The story is utterly tragic and violent--it made me think about the women in this world who have husbands like this. Even to the end this book was really heavy. This isn't a fairy tale with a marvelous ending. This book exhibits a different kind of reality regarding the relationships humans have with each other and the socicieites that they are a part of.
2`5`"don't worry. we're all just as we were. just the same. soon the abyss will be full of us. our detached houses will be o'ershadowed by the interest on the loan. and the boss will be off to the byre, to us animals on the chains of our wishes, waiting to be kicked about."
3`3`(trigger warning: rape)I loved a lot of this book. Elfriede Jelinek is a misandrist extraordinaire and refuses to be subtle in her indictments of men. That's great. But after a certain point I needed this book to be done. Desperately so. I had to goad myself with sugar cookies and a strawberry smoothie in order to go through with my final push. There are only so many euphemisms for dick and forced sex that a person can reasonably handle, and it gets repetitive and exhausting after a while. The only thing the husband in this book did was rape his wife, or talk about raping his wife, or plan to rape his wife, or drug their child so he could rape his wife in peace. It's horrifying. And even the solace she tries to take in another man backfires in maybe the most stomach-churning way I have ever read on paper. Nothing that happens in this book is good. You will not feel cozy. You might, at most, smirk at the thought of castrating someone. This shit is bleak. But my respect of Elfriede Jelinek remains strong. I think we just need to go on a break.
4`1`.I was nearly to interrupt reading this. One point is for one who translated this awful mess.
5`2`A bit much - a sex infused book gone horribly wrong.
6`4`A disturbing, compelling read about the abyss of a system, of a marriage. Grotesque, cruel, crushing, belonging to a fierce reality of power, control and submission. This book undid me at times, gave me grief and pain. Jelinek's text is effective and masterful, engaging the reader in dense, unyielding language, demanding that the reader witness and absorb Gerti's trials.
7`4`A powerful book, perhaps the most painful novel I have read. The sad thing is that is it amazingly relevant as the mind-sets described in the book are perfectly represented by Donald Trump, a view of sex as a right earned through money and power, as sex as a violent way to demonstrate power, and the capitalist system that cultivates those type of relationships. This book is rough, I would describe it as 200 pages of the Crucifix violence scene from "The Exorcist" movie followed by a final scene to the novel that is even more painful.This is a magnificent piece of art, but there are very few people I would recommend read this book, though it was recommended to me by my Uncle.
8`3`Acid, but a good novel, in Jelinek's style
9`3`Acidic novel detailing the relationship within one well-to-do Austrian family - father, mother and young son. The relationships are all antagonistic and power-based. The father as head of a local paper processing plant is "the man" of the village. His relationship with his family is similar. The wife and son are deemed property and he makes use of them as he desires when he desires.I found the book to be an extreme example of family relationships and bitter and almost nihilistic.Not a pleasant book but well written for all that.
10`null`Do read. If you like Haneke, this is for you. If you don't, read for violence alone? Also, it's low on weepy lady affectations, given the subject matter (nice?!). Bottom line: beautifully cold, maybe empty, we like.
11`5`Her constructions are the language of trashy radio/tv pop spit back in your face. It's the most scathing critique of contemporary life I've read in a while. Dismal and poetic.
12`1`I couldn't finish it. I think Jelinek is the only person who understands it completely and perfectly. I sure don't. There is something deeply disturbing about this book.
13`1`I couldn't finish it; relentless abusive sex and domination, without a bit of eroticism. I'm sure that was the point, but even though one slows down to look at the car wreck, there's only so long one can linger before passing by.
14`1`I don't buy the "brilliant-satire-of-the-modern-world" nonsense. This is a string of scenes of wanton sexual violence and torture that gets, first annoying, then boring, after a few pages. It is more distressing than shocking. In a pre-Nobel Prize interview, Jelinek wondered why Thomas Bernhard was popular in Austria since, like her, he was trashing his homeland. The answer is obvious : Bernhard is fun whereas Jelinek isn't.
15`1`I found this book to be one of the most pornographic and sickest novels I've ever read. It is meandering, often rambling with incoherence that tries to depict the plight of women who are subjected to a rigid male hierarchy. I understand that this was part of the whole extreme battle of the sexes trope that the book satirizes and fleshes out, but I did not enjoy it. It happened to be some of the most painful 200 pages I've ever encountered.
16`1`I have a lot of respect for this author. But I couldn't handle the domestic rape scenes in this book. The good thing is that in no way does the rape come across as sexy. But I still had no desire to finish the book.
17`null`I heard that's very interesting....
18`3`I might return to this. It's well written, but I'm just not in the mood for modernist games. Sometimes it's ok, but the writing needs to blow me away – or at least be funny – in order to keep me turning the page. There was some beautiful passages and set pieces (some hot sex scenes and a few funny takes on the oh-so-virile-and-powerful paterfamilias/capitalist) but eventually I decided I had better things to do. I'm still willing to give Jelinek, and even this book, another chance – I do like hateful writers and I do tend to like Austrians, so this book goes back to my shelf instead of back to the book store.
19`null`I really admired The Piano Teacher, and I was curious since this one the Nobel prize, but this was far too brutal. The general themes and metaphors become apparent in the first chapter and from then on it gets quite repetitive in the awfulness of the characters. Although I admit the writing is very nice-very rich wordplay that creates a swirling effect. It was also interesting to read a novel with an absolute misandrist view. But it was all a bit too much.
20`2`I was disappointed with this book. I loved  The Piano Teacher and  Wonderful Wonderful Times. This was a bit of a dud. For starters, it was repetitive. Mostly, the woman's husband just hit her and had humiliating sex with her. Rape might be a better word. I get that she has issues with male/female relations, but this was just sorta absurd. Despite all the graphic sex, it was even kinda boring. I was drawn in to her other novels and thought about them for weeks after I read them. I couldn't stop talking about them. This one, I put down, had a stiff drink, and went on my slightly less merry way.
21`5`Intense, unique experience. People in this book (in author's reality) are not really people, they are more animals, or even worse, hating evil machines hitting each other in every possible way. She is depicting this boiling hell that exists under the mask of beautiful civilized idyllic place. Whatever your creative writing teacher tells you you must not do, Jelinek will do it, and she will do it with virtuosity and necessary lever of aggression, saying "Piss off" to rules in art.
22`4`It would be hard to call this an enjoyable read. The sexual violence is brutal, and constant, tempered only by the level of metaphor in the description and the relentlessly ironic (and shifting) perspective. But if you want an engaging read of Marxist feminism as told through a very short and brutal story, this novel would be a good choice. The writing is poetic and abstract, and has its own beauty despite the subject matter. The language in this translation makes me wonder about the difficulties of translating something like this into English. Some of the plays on language are so specifically English that I wonder whether they belong to the original or the translation. In particular, the poetry in the writing can't possibly all be present in the original. See the following passage:"Ah, the privy parts and privy arts of mankind! All that's required of womankind is that she reck his rod (not wreck his rod), rock his go ahead, toss his rocks off."What could that possibly be in the original German? The puns, the euphemisms, even the specific allusion to Hopkins are all so specifically English. Makes me wish I were fluent in German too, to do an accurate side-by-side reading.This is not a casual read, and I'd only recommend it if you like a challenge, both in the themes and just the language itself. But if Jelinek's overall themes and style speak to you, then you will thank yourself for choosing this.
23`4`It's easy to be tempted to think that the book is an absurd exaggeration, even misrepresentation of reality. But look around you and you will see that people are living in ridiculousness without a clue about it. This book is an atrocious exposé of the decaying human condition. Jelinek has created a powerful and interesting narrative voice which I believe only a woman is capable of having. A difficult read certainly, because of the non-linear train of thoughts, yet it's all worth the time to open our eyes to a reality we have refused to acknowledge.
24`4`It's true: it's brutal. Almost every sentence contains rape or some kind of domestic abuse. When you want the wife to escape, she can't handle herself. An incredible commentary on the economy of sex and marital roles.
25`null`I’m a big fan of Michael Haneke’s films, and after seeing his The Piano Teacher, and learning that it was an adaptation of a novel by a Nobel laureate, I bought the book and read it and thought it very good. And then recently I thought it about time I read more Jelinek, so I picked up a copy of Lust, as it was quite short. It was perhaps not the wisest book to read on my daily commute, given the title. But never mind. The story is a brutal depiction of a marriage in wich the wife is treated as chattel by her husband. And when she eventually breaks free and finds herself a lover, he proves just as bad. What I had not remembered from The Piano Teacher, and perhaps that was down to the translator, but Lust was one long string of wordgames and puns and plays on words. It was relentless. Given its subject, it should come as no surprise the wordplay mostly focuses on sex, and especially on the male sex organ. I have no idea how this worked in German, or in the Austrian dialect in which Jelinek writes, but in English it felt to me like a dilution of the novel’s central point. The wife is entirely subject to the husband, she exists to satisfy his sexual desires, just as much as she is there to look after him and their spoilt son. Some of the expressions used, “shot his bolt”, for example, feel too… childish, schoolboyish, and while I get that the breadth and variety are what’s important, it does seem to detract from the brutality. This is an ugly book, about an ugly subject, so perhaps the wordplay is intended to add to that ugliness and it works much better in German. But this is definitely a book that provokes a reaction, and I’ll be reading more Jelinek.
26`2`Lust is a uniquely difficult and unpleasant book to read. It tells the creepy tale of a rich family in an alpine town through their sexual relationship. Little happens - there is a slightly curved plot arc with Gerti's infidelity and then a rather surprising (considering no previous concessions are given to the conventions of plot) twist of an ending that (while not one of the various twists I expected) hammered the final nail in the coffin - Jelenek does everything she can to make you loath these characters and the world they inhabit.The bizarre thing about Lust is the constant feeling that the Direktor and his wife are supposed to represent mankind as a whole - their names are not always used and the Man is often capitalized. There is an everyman feel to Jelenek's critique of humanity and it is not a positive impression she wants to give us. The Man is a archetype of the aggressive, sexually dominant capitalist. The son is a spoilt, Freudianly cursed little brat. The woman is used and abused and searching for love.And that is what is missing. Throughout the whole struggle there is not a glimpse of human emotion. Sex is disconnected from any human feeling and, therefore, it loses its interest. The writing is powerful and shocking, so regularly shocking that it becomes shocking again how often she repeats her point. The scorn emanating through is tangible. Jelenek uses every euphemism possible and then some - sex is compared to everything, farming, housework, driving a car, skiing, sailing, violence, machines, making money, politics. The double meanings (often very clever taken by themselves) are so frequent as to be very unsubtle and must have been a real pain to translate. Everything is sexualised but not humanised. Jelenek inverts the world, Naturalising (Nature another often capitalized word) the mechanical and mechanising human processed like sex and work. There is a sense of being trapped in a human machine, in our own nature, of being unable to be anything else other than this excreting, urinating Man and this beaten, desperate woman.Jelenek seems aware of the awfulness of her vision, it even creeps into the occasional first person quips - there is an authorial observer to all this human perversity. The problem I had was that it seemed to be a falsely pessimistic account of human nature. As a read it has its masochistic edge but the last line perfectly captures your mood on finishing it, 'But now rest a while'. 3
27`null`Mentioned that I wanted to read Women as Lovers and Carol sent this to me par poste (or maybe when we were in Lodi? I don't remember.) I was going through a weird funk and this book just made that funk that much more pronounced. I felt like there was almost a strange language gap and maybe Jelinek's descriptions didn't exactly crossover well in English? I couldn't get through most paragraphs without re-reading it then feeling disgusted about what was going on. I ended up giving myself more entertaining/fluffy reads between attempts to tackle this madness and the pauses just got longer and longer.I think I'll hold onto this. I feel like I might appreciate it more when I'm in my gray hair days and am bitter at the world.
28`4`Nobody does it better than Elfriede Jelinek, when it comes to writing about the filthy side of human beings, not just any dark side, real filthy side!A husband sexually abuses his housewife. Industrialists and politicians abuse the nature. Herman is the manager (director) of a paper mill in Austrian countryside, who exploits the nature and local people. Gerti, his housewife, is sexually exploited by Hermann on daily basis.Gerti wanders into a nearby skiing resort in her evening gown and slippers at the height of her drunkenness, has a sexual encounter with Michael, a self centered youth with political hopes. For 2/3 of this book, Gerti's laborious walking episode is interlaced with fragments of her daily sexual abuses, this is a beautiful piece of narration!There is some allegorical connection between the sexual abuse and capitalism, Elfriede Jelinek's lame marxist remarks could have been toned down a bit though! They are so repetitive and really get on to your nerves towards the end.Elfriede Jelinek is the kind of writer, who makes you feel ashamed for not knowing the language a book was originally written. Even though Michael Hulse did a wonderful job in translating this complex prose, somehow you don't get to sufficiently experience the "musical flow of voices and counter-voices" for which Elfride Jelinek is known for.One word of caution, this is not a book for weak hearts. You are wading into a dangerous water, you might end up despising everything in life and everybody in the world!
29`4`Not an easy read. But all worth it. Metaphors after metaphors tie the not so complex script and lead us to a disturbing narrative.
30`5`Not for everyone. Rather like Sinclair Lewis's Babbitt with sex.
31`1`Not my cup of tea, I can really see why a lot of people had strong opinions about the Novel Prize
32`1`Not my cup of tea. It was a pain to read it.
33`4`Oh, what a difficult read, felt like a poem for the most part, set in paragraphs. The story is essentially brief, the narrative comprised of a few main events (with several "rapes" thrown in for good measure). The ending event was most striking and disturbing of all, and says a lot I think about the role of the woman in this book, that is, as a vessel for the man in ways both literal and figurative.
34`5`Still hilariously funny and horribly accurate, scary.
35`null`The language of porn, the story of modern slavery. Harsh and well written.
36`5`The only book I’ve read in the recent years that marvelously challenged my reading with it’s unique and original style.The theme was exciting as well.
37`4`There is a peculiar reliance on language in Jelinek's books. So far each novel shows a different side of Jelinek. Lust is Jelinek at her most witty, with language games and puns abounding.The language here is in service to, of course, lust and sexuality. Words are often followed by a homophonic twin, double entendres and playful or juvenile nicknames for genitals are as abundant as the husband's sexual whims. Remember how exhausting the ten-minute *YOU-KNOW* scene in Gaspar Noe's Irreversible was? I don't mean that this novel is as thematically gruesome, but it similarly aims toward exhaustion as an aesthetic effect, with sex scenes spanning numerous pages.The prose is smattered with semen and full of the anxious pressure that anticipates and demands sexual release - it is tense and taut with sexuality (a book I had to take care to guard from others' view on the bus and train).This is not intimate love, however. This is a man exercising his will and control over what is his property by virtue of Austria's patriarchal society which, as was communicated in her Women as Lovers, allows women little hope for any course in life aside from that as a wife and a mother. Gerti is her husband's receptacle as the novel bluntly puts it, and little more. She is a mother as well, but the child exists as yet another recipient of the father's almighty will and frequent beatings.Gerti searches for salvation in another lover, Michael, but, alas, her affair, despite her hopes, is certain to come to no good end - is he not yet another man compelled above all by lust?
38`1`This book should be kept locked and given only after saying special password as in old movies about spies. I couldn't read that - to write about sex you have to have a special gift, not just talent for writing.
39`4`This is a brutal, punishing work. Its unrelenting nature is built upon an interesting critique of capitalistic excess (or capitalism itself?) and the behavior of men towards women. Graphic, powerful, playful but in the manner of a pun murmured by the condemned person to the hooded executioner.Though this was a desperate slog I'm anxious to read another work by this Austrian.
40`3`This is a quick read I can't seem to finish. Interesting writing style and the story is vivid and violent and there's a little sex too.
41`2`This is a rape manual. I kid you not. There's a rape fantasy in each page.I HATE Jelinek. I don't mean her writing. I hate HER.
42`2`This is becoming tiresome, even if Jelinek's insights into "contemporary" (this was written in '89) existence do bear consideration. Later: Finally finished! I feel as if I should bathe my soul in bleach, though.
43`3`This is kind of a default rating because I don't know how I feel about this book. This book is sex-filled, but not very sexy. Jelinek uses sex in the narrative to draw comparison to capitalism as a theme, this was apparent quickly. Sex is on every page, no exaggeration, rough sex, often violent sex. Even with the monotony of the narrative, I couldn't stop reading because it was shocking, and the use of language was amazing, Jelinek definitely qualifies as a wordsmith. I feel a tip of the hat should be given to the translator since I am sure that this book was a pain to translate.
44`1`This won the Nobel Prize? What a joke. Its prose is all over the place, the story is depressing... And the story itself takes so fricking long to get into, such are the excessive descriptions of things, scenery and metaphors, so much so one forgets what the novel is about. I wasn't too sure that I'd want to read about sexual violence (rape in marriage) anyway. I didn't finish it. I barely made 15 pages. So not my thing. It was all mind-numbing, dull and erratic attempts at metaphors, analogies and descriptors, rather than story-telling. I would have given it zero stars despite having only managed to read 15 pages. The OCD in me was compelled to rate it anyway. 
45`5`To be sure, this is a difficult book. But it is also one of the most sustained, intense, acid feats of prose I have ever seen. Though skiers are a group for whom Jelinek lavishes special bile, her own writing reminds me of a terrifyingly reckless and exciting downhill skier. Jelinek puts forth a radically feminist, radically anti-capitalist vision all the more powerfully for the symbolic and surrealist chances that she takes. This is all out war, folks, and for once the good side is winning.
46`1`Utterly violent and depressing. I quit at p 96
47`4`Wow, what amazing language on the one hand side and what gruesome content on the other side. The permanent stream of consciousnes is amazingly funny and associative. The protagonist is a wife who gets sexuelly exploited in any way immaginable without the faintest hope for a happy ending. Quite a strange but brilliantly written mixture.
48`1`as somebody else said.."Nobel prize my ass". But one must say, it requires a lot of work to write such a boring book about sex and lust.
49`5`http://msarki.tumblr.com/post/9980943...Sitting down this autumn to the work of transposing all my hand-written work from last summer onto my computer I am somewhat surprised at how relevant this particular work of Elfriede Jelinek is to what I myself had been impelled to write about. Reading for me is far more than a diversion from my life. This novel makes me think. Clearly I am no longer of the patriarchal and consumer-driven society I have been born into, and I have done my utmost to insure against my falling back into what I so laboriously rid myself of further becoming. Yes, I am married to a woman I have sex with, but never a day passes in which I am not grateful for her and what she does for me. I never feel entitled to anything awarded me except for the continuance of a fair shake and honest relationship. Deceit and covert affronts of power are expressly not my cup of tea. Elfriede Jelinek is a poet. Or the translator, Michael Hulse, is a poet. It matters not to me who the responsible party is here. Fact is, this novel is a masterpiece in brutal honesty. Fiction as fact. I know these people she writes about and they exist in the world I live in. They always have. They are my neighbors and we live in the same towns.A third of the way into this beautifully profound though vicious treatise the narrator, after somewhat sarcastically speaking of a factory worker fetching from the dispenser a refreshing Coke, says the word I. She, or he, unhesitatingly and frankly makes strong claims.Wood is pulped and the pulp is processed at the mill by people who’ve been pulped…Obviously the opinions voiced in this narrator’s countless personal attacks are broad and thoroughly encompassing. Because of mounting evidence and personal experience I feel confident that Elfriede is not exclusively a man-hater as others have previously suggested. To label her one is totally unfair. Obviously she equally hates all that is oppressive and insanely preposterous, which covers enormous swaths of ground and leaves her much else to expose in the course of her saying so. As for the pitiful women she portrays she clearly positions herself above and beyond them, and in fact holds them responsible for the spousal abuse they receive inasmuch as they are themselves slaves to wanting the things and prestige that only money can buy. This mass disease of consumerism is as much at fault as the worldly desire for more money and property. Through the ages this hunger has undoubtedly proven to feed a vicious cycle of abuse. In matters of sexual behaviors Jelinek goes well over the line in order to be herself appropriately absurd. The gargantuan number of orifices filled and splayed seem almost hilarious and often delightfully insane. …Nature presupposes sheer scale: anything of a smaller size could never excite us or entice us, tempt us to buy a dirndl dress or a hunting outfit…She is equally without hope for all who are oppressed. It is the human condition we are born with. Oppressed people the world over resort to life’s foibles to determine the results and direction of their flawed and blemished lives. The ones-in-charge continue to profit and consider themselves superior in their disgusting delusions of grandeur. There are so many of life’s examples to this affect that Jelinek has little trouble digressing and exploring the diverse and meandering avenues and countrysides of our often pathetic and meaningless existence. …All day long a man lives off the beautiful image of his wife, only to have her nag all evening…She and the village women and all of us, there we stand, dripping and thawing, facing the kitchen stove and counting the tablespoonfuls in which we dole ourselves out…Unrelenting in her assault of all, and the insults she spews upon us, Jelinek scours her cynical mind for the strongest corrosive agent she may engage. Her courageous honesty is so absurd to be somewhat funny and profanely enjoyable to read. A weaker mind of lesser character could never delight in these scribblings patterned in short paragraphs of hers that never fail to inspire a reader to go on and hear what else she might have to say about these people we all should know and be dreadfully aware of. Otherwise we are one of them as well. Better to be a recreational observer slouched within the stuffing of our leisure chair, devoid of any personal feeling of responsibility that urges us to also merge within these irrelevant lives as additional willing participants. …Even the station-master’s slender signal baton is almost too much for her. She is obeying her own command. And no one else’s… In the midst of her life, this woman often likes to think she has to get out of her alignment alongside other women with sagging breasts and hopes who have docked beside her…Jelinek, in her way, promotes self-awareness and personal responsibility. When a reader is offended by these painfully direct accounts and graphic details explicitly made out for us it pauses me to consider the source of their written complaints and credit them to another version of the typically judgmental and self-righteous one who holds little to no credibility based on a typically guilty history. The sensitive man who feels somehow affronted as well is considered also in less than a good light as we are all complicit of these same behaviors and thoughts no matter how hard we impress ourselves and others in our attempts to deny them. For wary readers it seems Jelinek’s incessant bombardment is meant in order to wear one down. She is anything but taciturn in her sometimes disgusting assaults so perversely avowed. Two-thirds through this generously elongated tirade marks a new measure of tiredness. She flirts with boredom. It is possible the book could have ended at this same mark. But perhaps she still has something new and yet unheard of to say? Surely it is hoped her constant fucking and sucking might beget a new meaning. It is true the hairdresser fails at keeping Gerti fresh. No longer available to Jelinek are any additional analogies for going downhill. Perhaps she could have the fuckers skiing backwards, or perhaps in reverse? …The woman doesn’t improve from constant use, but if she herself wants to avail herself of a young man, make herself available to a fellow who lives nearby: no, it won’t do! ... So Gerti degrades herself even more. A husband who uses her every hole to fill and gorge with his own juices and then leaves her soiled and bent with nary a kiss goodbye is still not enough abuse for her so Gerti ventures out to seek more in the shape and forms of youth that are now and forever escaping her. …But we, us extras, we are so difficult to move, we hang leaden upon our catheters, through which our warm waste waters trickle wretchedly away…Being drunk and spread out on the snow of her own digging, wanting too much to be loved, enamored of herself, delusional enough so that gangs of young men and women are allowed to expose and fondle, grab and mishandle her hidden places, her creases and folds torn and spread enough to spew their juices laughably, considered by these kids as no longer needed and instead worn and desperately used up. …Gerti is put in her car. Quiet, now! How shall I put it? She has been at the mercy of hands and tongues…And for some of us having been roughly groped and fondled like this would be just what we have wanted. An orgy designed for denying personal despair. But not Gerti. She wants the young man Michael and not the rest of what comes with him. The narrator frankly tells us that this woman has to get attached to an asshole like Michael, of all people… He grabs roughly inside the front of her coat and dress, and, laughing, tugs and twists her nipples…The book is strikingly more about regrets over life choices rather than the popular blurbed-war between the sexes. Poor choices and not being true to one’s self plays into this work in far greater measure than feminism and spousal abuse. On almost every page men and women being caught up in superficial looks and pretentious appearances are shown as contagious diseases prevalent throughout our consumer-driven societies. …Torn and tormented, we become visible, and we want to look good for others, to think of what we paid for our clothes, we no longer have what we paid and we notice the lack when we have to undress and caress our partner in love…Defeated, in the world of lust, youth rules. Age is not kind, and life simply wears one out.…Thus their round fat bodies hum away, life goes on, man vanishes continually in death, the hours sink to the ground, but women flit numbly about the house, never safe from all the blows that fate deals…There is no hope. And ultimately a god is blamed or held responsible for this creation. It is hard to imagine a work like this becoming popular. …Flabbergasted, the men gape into their women’s holes, torn by life, and yes, they shudder, as if they knew that the box had long been empty from which the seeds have been shaken out for years. But the dear women are so attached to them... In this book Elfriede Jelinek has much to say. Of which ample need impels all of us to consider. And where we might also discover why her violence is most driven.
50`3`i can't imagine how tough it is to translate this so mad props to michael hulse, its like wall to wall deadpun deilvery and i think i'd put a gun to my head if i had to deal with it. i think the Greed had slightly more interesting prose than this one, and also significantly more plot i guess, so while i really liked this one it felt like it was orbiting the same points innumerously... the downside to jelinek's thing is that when it's not really working it kinda reads like cialis spam emails. when its good she really gets that stream-of-stream-of-consciousness anthony kiedis stylee ripping... life is rape---He has to make a good showing! He tries out ever new positions from which to kick his cart down into his wife's quiet waters and start paddling like a maniac. He doesn't need water wings, he'll never pull one of those plastic things over his red head simply to stay in good health. His wife has been healthy for the longest time anyway. She writhes beneath him and cries out as a whole herd of seeds plunge stampeding from his well-appointed glans.Frau Direktor puts a brave face on things, she paints her face and adds a sur-face to the surface nature's provided her with.^^^^lots of lines like thisvvvvAnd she puts up with his ever-ready meat battery.Women is a trinity of pleasures, to be grabbed up top, down below or in the middle.Sex is the downtown of our lives, shopping precinct and leisure center and red-light district, all in one, but it isn’t where we live. We prefer a little elbow room, a bigger living room, with appliances we can turn on and off.
51`2`no need to read the whole book, first (or any) 20 pages would be enough to get the point
52`5`this book has two aspects - the brilliant analysis and mirroring of sex with capitalism, and the wearying repetition. by the first thirty pages, much of which i read on the el (hoping no one would glance into the book and see the inevitably sordid & brutal sex scene of the moment), i emerged from the el tunnel with new eyes toward the world, as if the veil had been dropped. it's a rare book that accomplishes such a thing in its readers! so i was sold. but despite how brilliant it was, i'm not sure when i'll want to dive into another of jelinek's works again. it was brutal to read, and by halfway through, i wanted a significant number of the characters to die. also, i can't imagine having anyone with whom to discuss this book. i wouldn't dare recommend it to anyone, lest they hate me for it. 
53`5`this was the final nail in my already-sturdy feminist coffin/mansion & this book broke my 3rd eye in 80 ways when i was 17. jelinek's musicality transcended what i thought belonged in sentences, its cadence and beauty allowing for the violence it contains to be both swallowed and amplified, like those pills with dinosaur sponges in them. it's harder to recommend to friends than, say, Wonderful, Wonderful Times, but to be 17 & to have stumbled upon this & to learn that prose could be poetic and that aggression was not only nuanced but still all red,red,red was important & something i'd try to pass on to any critically-thinking, latently-frustrated young woman about to embark for adulthood.
