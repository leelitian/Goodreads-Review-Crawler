3`4` "We'll meet again. Don't know where. Don't know when. But I know we'll meet again some sunny day." Thank you for curing me from a reading slump.
4`5` Despite being lost in all the architecture bits, I really enjoyed this classic tale.
5`3` The Hunchback of Notre Dame was a nightmare to persevere with. It wasn't so much a potboiler, but it took far longer than needed for the core story to thicken up. Lots of parts were overly descriptive, and while it offers a good tone to feel like you're in the setting, it could easily be skipped. From the title, you must already automatically know the story from the Disney film but this is very, very different. Darker, not for kids and a tragedy. Everyone in this story was obsessed with someone other than the person that was obsessed with them. Rinse and repeat. A viscious cycle. I wouldn't go so far to say I enjoyed this book but I found it interesting.
6`4` The Hunchback of Notre-Dame by Victor Hugo is a literary classic, and has been praised as well as criticized for it‚Äôs use of the catholic faith, priesthood, and the gypsy people. The novel asks deep questions about what makes someone a human, what is man to do when they can‚Äôt follow God‚Äôs law, and is someone who is different from the majority a monster? The novel does an amazing job in asking and trying to answer these questions, as well as developing deep characters, such as it‚Äôs main protagonist, and antagonist. 	When the novel was published in March of 1831, a small time author by the name of Victor Hugo became famous, and would go on to right other classics such as The Man Who Laughs, and Les Miserables. He wrote the novel in the Romantic and Gothic Fiction genres, and was able to draw on some of the best features of both for his work. The plot of the novel is based, somewhat, in reality. About a French nation that distrusted the gypsies, a priest who falls short on quite a few of his vows, and a man who only wants to find his place in the world. The plot can be very engaging, and it allows you to feel sympathy or understand the characters better. Hugo uses the plot and the genres to develop his characters in a very interesting and intriguing way. He takes the stories antagonist, Frodo, and gives him humanity, he looks after Quasimodo as if he were his own son, but slowly begins to dip into madness. Quasimodo, the main character and namesake of the novel, is deformed and deaf, and throughout the novel begins to wonder what his place is, and at the end arguably finds it. 	The novel was adapted by Disney into an animated movie, that has many merits on it‚Äôs own, but changes a lot from the original source material. Making it arguably the weaker of the two works. Hugo wrote stories that mostly took place in his home nation of France. Such as his novel, later musical and movie, Les Miserables. In that work he tells a story that takes place during the French Revolution , where the french people gained their independence from their king. And in a way that theme is also present in this work to, as the gypsies try to find their freedoms, and Quasimodo tries to find freedom from the bell tower of Notre Dame. 	 The man message of the novel is that a human is God‚Äôs creation, and is far more than just how they are seen by others. This novel should be read by anyone who enjoys French history, the genres that it is a part of, people who like a story that could also be counted as a parable in the way that it is written. As well as fans of Hugo‚Äôs other works, and the Disney animated movie. 
7`null` What am I, completely dense?? I can't believe that I literally just realized that Victor Hugo also wrote Les Mis√©rables..
8`2`"A Classic".... I hate when I see this title attached to a book, it makes me think there's something wrong with me if I don't like it. Victor Hugo is a great author but I'm convinced he was paid by the word and very hungry when he wrote this. I had to drag myself through 3 chapters (in different places) that had practically no purpose. They didn't further the story or give background to an important character (or even a minor character) I'm not sure why Hugo felt it necessary to describe Paris street by street if he wasn't going to make the knowledge integral to the plot and I have even stronger feelings about his 30+ page description of the cathedral. I don't know if it was really necessary or even productive to tell me how each window is different in style, composition and artistic value. I don't really care how each pillar developed and was built over the decades it took to build. I understand Hugo is painting a picture but does the canvas need to be so big? The only productive part of these chapters was the chance it gave me to brush up on my skimming skills. (Tolkein is also a very useful author for this purpose). Once Hugo began telling me a story I was very happy with his style and the plot development. I don't know if I was supposed to like the poet the most but he was my favorite character even if his adoration of Esmerelda's goat bordered on the creepy. All in all a good book, I recommend it.

In original French's title is Notre-Dame de Paris. In English version, is The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, and Indonesian version : Si Cantik dari Notre Dame which it means The Beauty of Notre-Dame, different perspectives, huh? üòâ.It was happy Sad ending story, which I like. üíï The story was heart-breaking and tragic...‚Äú.... also came to a tragical end; he married‚Äù. üòÖ pg. 566..This definitely be one of my favourite classic, I loved the setting, all roads lead to the cathedral, a walking tour of Paris, pointing out the interesting people and all the buildings along the way..It's not entirely tragic life, there's humorous too, and the love obsession is totally doom..I remembered dnf watching this Disney Movie, coz I prefer Princess at that time instead of a Hunchback Hero. üòÖ.Disney must be work hard to make this into a children taste..So, I 'm a bit surprise with the ending, in a good way. Well, I even agree with it, after all. Overall it's 4.5‚≠êüëç
10`5`"Daylight is for everyone. Why do they give me only the night?" Esmeralda's question reminds me of a line from 'Man of La Mancha' that moves me: "I do not think they were asking why they were dying, but why they had ever lived."Such is the theme of Hugo's novel, forcing us to question why some people are fated with unbearable suffering? It is a tragic tale, but also at times a thrilling and adventurous one difficult to put down. The combination results in truly phenomenal storytelling. I loved this book. 
11`4`"Dragostea √ÆnseamnƒÉ sƒÉ fii doi »ôi sƒÉ nu fii dec√¢t unul. Un bƒÉrbat »ôi o femeie care se contopesc √Æntr-un √Ænger. Dragostea e cerul.""...CƒÉci chiar dacƒÉ nu crezi √Æn nimic, existƒÉ clipe √Æn via»õƒÉ c√¢nd √ÆmpƒÉrtƒÉ»ôe»ôti totdeauna religia templului aflat cel mai la √Ændem√¢nƒÉ."
12`5`"Love is like a tree; it grows spontaneously, strikes its roots deep into our whole being, and often continues to flourish over a heart in ruins. And the inexplicable part of it is, that the blinder this passion, the more tenacious it is. It is never stronger than when it is utterly unreasonable."This book exceeded every expectation! I did not expect to like it as much as I did, it was a heart wrenching masterpiece that was beautiful and tragic. I loved the way things were introduced in the beginning and so cleverly tied in to the plot and playing such important roles in the climax. This is was an AMAZING book! 
13`5`"Man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart." This has created a theme that stories have focussed on for centuries. It is one that we try to teach different ways with more unique characters.When one first reads a synopsis of "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame", they would easily assume they will be reading another author's method of bringing this theme into their story. However, very shortly into the novel one finds that Quasimodo is not orginally this fully rejected outcast for his appearance. At the beginning of the novel he is actually being praised by a large crowd. His rejection comes as different incidences are misinterpreted and people begin to make the wrong assumptions.As the story continues on this happens to more characters than only Quasimodo. And other characters make mistakes by acting too quickly. It turns out that this story is about making the wrong judgements based on appearences. Only, it's not about the appearences of the characters, it's about the appearences of what is happening around our characters.When I noticed this, I realized that the whole book turned out to be about ignorance (the ignorance of the characters in what they were doing and the assumptions they made). If any of the characters would stop and figure out what had truly been happening, things would have been solved, but everytime this was a possibility they would make a new assumption and the problems would escalate. To me, the most stunning aspect of this was that the consequences did not only take effect on those that had been ignorant. In the same way, the end of the novel was only that upsetting if we remain ignorant of the fact that everything is finally brought to a close and those characters we care most about wanted something they could only come closest to through the way the novel ended (Hugo knew what he was doing in the titles of the chapters). Though it may be one of the most disturbing novels I've read, it has also taken it's place among my top ten favorites.

15`5`"The Hunchback of Notre Dame" by Victor Hugo is a book centered on the society and culture of Paris in the 1400s. I started to read this book when I was around seventeen, when my father bought me the unabridged version of the book. The beginning was slow, partially because the language was hard to get through at times and the informational chapters that seemed useless were killing me! But, before you give up entirely on the book, I can say with certainty that once the plotline really began to develop, ‚ÄúHunchback‚Äù became one of the best books I‚Äôve ever read! The character and theme development that Hugo explores in this piece are exquisitely done, and I couldn't put the book down at all. Every chance I got, I would read it, even if I had just a sliver of time. The story is unique, yet the prejudice portrayed and the feelings that the characters face are still real to this day. Hugo, yet again, captured the plight of the minority and impoverished in this book, which constantly reminds me of how revolutionary of an author he was. In the piece, Hugo displays a multidimensional aspect to all of his characters by showing us their thought processes and desires. The title character, Quasimodo, is labeled as pitiful and as a sinner because of his stature and deformities. In spite of this labeling, his nature is the kindest, most loyal, and most heroic of anyone in the book. His true characteristics show in how fiercely loyal and obedient he is to anyone he truly loves, such as the affection he shows to his caretaker, Archdeacon Claude Frollo, and the caring attitude he shows to the gypsy, Esmeralda. Esmeralda is fiercely independent, sympathetic to minorities like her, and is a practitioner of justice and fairness. However, as a sixteen year old girl, she is still naive and lets her own judgments cloud her vision. One example of the good and bad aspects of her personality is her pity for Quasimodo as he is flogged and the generosity that she shows him by bringing him water. Yet, she is also reluctant to allow Quasimodo near her due to his deformity, and even recoils in his presence. Claude Frollo, the archdeacon, antagonist and the person whose thought process the reader is exposed to the most, is seen at the beginning as a pious holy man who follows God‚Äôs will and who is strictly celibate. However, his lust for Esmeralda is his undoing and changes him into a conniving, plotting, hardened, yet pitiful man that the reader can sympathize with. As you can see, all the characters in this book possess good and bad traits, which brings a more colorful approach, rather than a black and white approach, of good and evil. Hugo explores many themes in his book. One theme that he explores is the concept of societal judgment. One concept I found interesting was that Quasimodo had the purest soul of all the characters in the book, even though his deformities labelled him a ‚Äúcreation of the devil.‚Äù In Parisian society at the time (and European culture overall), people who were deformed were considered to be cursed by God because of the sins their forebearers committed. Therefore, deformed persons were social outcasts from the moment of birth. Quasimodo, throughout the book, is called a fool and a half-wit, and is avoided by citizens in Paris altogether, with the exception of Frollo. However, I theorize that Quasimodo physically carried the brunt of the sins for others in the book, despite being the purest character. I felt that all of the beautiful people that were considered normal in the society such as Frollo, Phoebus, and Esmeralda were the biggest sinners, and Quasimodo was Hugo's physical manifestation of their sins, which makes him an important character in the book even though he plays a more subtle role. Another theme that the author explores is the concept of good versus evil. As I said before, all the characters and their traits bring a more colorful approach to the concept of good and evil, meaning that not one character is only good or only bad. One way that Hugo portrays the good and evil traits within his characters is by showing the reader the thought process and the internal struggles within each character. This gives the reader the chance to subjectively look at a character and lead them to their own conclusions. For instance, my favorite character in the book is Frollo because of Hugo's particular attention towards his internal struggle, where the reader could sympathize with him even though he was the antagonist. On the other hand, other book reviews will say that Frollo is a disgusting character for the same reason. Either way, Hugo‚Äôs approach to good and evil isn't written in a way where everyone agrees on who is good or bad, but instead allow them to develop their own opinions on each character for good reason. This seems to be a more realistic way of approaching a story rather than writing a character to be either good or evil with no gray area. One last main concept that is important in this book is the concept of love. Love is what corrupts, changes, limits and gets the characters in trouble. For instance, Quasimodo's love and devotion for Frollo limits him from truly helping Esmeralda, another person he loves, when she seeks Sanctuary within the cathedral walls. Esmeralda's love for Phoebus, a captain in the army with a misogynistic view on women, gets her in trouble with the law and endangers her life. The most prominent love that is documented is the unhealthy love that Frollo expresses for Esmeralda, in which he deludes himself into reasoning that it is her fault that he is tempted by her and comes to the conclusion that she is a witch. This toxic delusion is continually exposed to the reader in Frollo's thoughts, fears, hatred and lust for Esmeralda, a sixteen year old gypsy who wants nothing to do with him. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed and loved this book. I must warn potential readers that, when you read the book, you will notice that there are some chapters filled with information that you most likely will not need to know. Also keep in mind that this book can be very depressing, and it is a hard book to read at times, but reading and finishing this story has been satisfying. Hugo‚Äôs brilliance shine through this masterpiece, and I have no regrets reading this novel. 
16`5`"There is all that I ever loved"
17`3`"Victor Hugo began writing Notre-Dame de Paris in 1829, largely to make his contemporaries more aware of the value of the Gothic architecture"This can known by the 80 pages dedicated to discussing said architecture which tried and failed to be a relevant part of the story. While Hugo does a decent job of weaving the Quasimoto/Esmeralda/Frollo story it is mixed with far too much discussion of churches and Paris itself. If I wanted a history book....wait that would never happen.Sadly I prefer the disney version. Les Mis is still one of my favorite books, somehow Hugo's tangents and 200 page setups for a minor character work in that book. This one not so much. 3 stars because it is a classic love story and for the one scene where the deaf judge is presiding over the deaf Quasimoto.
18`4`'On the face of this aged queen of our cathedrals, by the side of a wrinkle, one always finds a scar. Tempus edax, homo edacior; which I should be glad to translate thus: time is blind, man is stupid.'An ode to Paris and all its historic buildings. The Hunchback of Notre Dame / Notre Dame de Paris is about the beauty of the French capital; containing detailed chapters about the architecture, history and streets of Paris. The dramatic story about Esmeralda, Quasimodo, Phoebus and Frollo feels like a background story; yet, quite an intense background story that left a great impression. Beautiful yet sad book, which I will definitely revisit in the future. Also, I always found the Disney movie adaptation quite sad, but literally feels like a walk in the park compared to what was written here. 
19`5`*Sob*It's just too beautiful for words.
20`3`.If these stones could speak ‚Ä¶.Victor Hugo wrote this book in 1829, largely to make his contemporaries more aware of the value of the Gothic architecture, which was neglected and often destroyed, only to be replaced by new buildings or defaced by replacing parts of buildings in a newer style (such as the beautiful glass window of N√¥tre Dame).The actual French title translates to ‚ÄûOur Lady in Paris‚Äú as it is not really about Quasimodo but about the cathedral of N√¥tre Dame.Now, in order to understand the core story, I have to go somewhat into detail. For those, who don‚Äôt want to know, I recommend skipping this paragraph, fair warning.We find ourselves in Paris in 1482. Archdeacon Frollo is torn between his oaths and his obsessive lust for the gypsy Esmeralda. He therefore instructs Quasimodo to kidnap Esmeralda. Quasimodo, a half-blind and meanwhile also deaf hunchback, loving Frollo ever since he took Quasimodo in when his mother abandoned him as a child, does as he‚Äôs told. However, Quasimodo is stopped by Captain Phoebus and his guards and is captured by them. Subsequently, he is sentenced to be flogged and turned on the pillory for an hour, followed by another hour‚Äôs public exposure. During this ordeal, he almost dies of thirst but Esmeralda, of all people, saves him by giving him water - which makes him fall in love with her.Frollo, meanwhile, driven half mad by jealousy, tries to kill Captain Phoebus and, when that fails, frames Esmeralda for the attempted murder since she keeps refusing him. Quasimodo saves her from the gallows by swinging down from N√¥tre Dame and taking her into the cathedral, claiming sanctuary for her. The leader of the gypsies then tries to rally the citizens of Paris to free Esmeralda before the Parliament can vote to deny her the right to sanctuary. However, Quasimodo mistakes their motives and repels them while thinking that the King‚Äôs men are there to help. Eventually, Esmeralda and Quasimodo are betrayed by Frollo, Esmeralda being handed over to the guards and hanged. Frollo, truly mad now, laughs while watching from a balcony high up on N√¥tre Dame, driving Quasimodo to push him off to his death. Then, Quasimodo vanishes (it is implied that he dies also, holding Esmeralda's body in a comforting embrace).This is not the entire story, not by far. But it is the core and what is usually addressed in movie adaptations and perhaps more than future readers want to know in advance (which is why I wrote that warning above).It has to be stated that Quasimodo does not feature too often in this story. The reason being that the story is more about the structure of the cathedral, its timelessness and what it witnessed ever since it was built. The author was trying to make the point that mere men don‚Äôt have the right to destroy or - through inaction - allow to come to harm such a magnificent and important piece of architecture. Nevertheless, it is a love story and one of the most tragic ones at that. It features all the elements relevant at the time: the aloof upper society including the uncaring ruling parties, the lower levels of society such as beggars and gypsies, artists, conflicted and not-to-be-trusted members of the clergy, outcasts. In short: the puppets and puppet masters.The book impresses with the author‚Äôs impeccable writing style, rich with lively descriptions that place one firmly amongst the characters. The author also effortlessly throws in historical information as decoration to describe the timelessness of structures and of works of art.Albeit this being a tragic romance, it is also definitely a satire full of sarcasm shown in people using gatherings in the church to gossip and make fun of others, or shown in how the people here react to current events and inventions:‚ÄûPrinting will kill bookselling.‚Äú since it supposedly is a ‚Äûwretched‚Äú German invention. *lol*Not to mention the social criticism that continuously exposes ludicrous customs, vanity, hypocrisy and other character weaknesses.Like Dumas, Hugo allows a sharp look at the times, at the different levels of society and politics but also at peoples‚Äô characters and occupations. Unlike Dumas, however, Hugo doesn‚Äôt quite manage to successfully walk the knife‚Äôs edge between bringing the surroundings and times alive through detailed descriptions, firmly placing the story through adding relevant historical information and clubbing the reader to death with too much information that has no immediate merit whatsoever. Nevertheless, it is an important piece and I very much enjoyed Bill Homewood's narration once again.

25`3`3.5 stars
26`3`3.5 stars -- more to come in the live stream, but TLDR is I'm glad that the readalong pushed me to get through this, because there are some real gems in here. But the circumstances under which this was written really show in terms of pacing which makes the chapter to chapter experience of reading this painful at times, and I likely would have DNFed without the group to keep me going. Still, in the end, this is a book I'm glad to have read, even if I didn't love reading it in the moment
27`4`3.5 stars? 4? I don't know.The point is I liked this book, I really did. The plot is intriguing, I knew little of it, just the ending of some of the characters, but it was a completely different experience to learn how they reach their ultimate epilogue. The plot is far more elaborate and fiery than I expected, a comprehensive story of Paris and its inhabitants that gives the same amount of space to the description of the city, of its architectures and size as well as to the characters, whose emotions are sought with accuracy in order to let the reader understand as much as possible about what goes on in their hearts and minds.They all have clear characterizations, strong and resolute emotions, even when they are represented as mild and lovely, like La Esmeralda: she never backs down from her revulsion for Claude Frollo, even when he offers her liberty in exchange for her love. They are all quite interesting protagonists, however I think that the most fascinating of them all was Claude Frollo. He should be the enemy, but I never really perceived him like that. He is torn between his vocation, the calling he devoted his life to, and this new ponderous feeling that he is unable to manage. In a set of characters that are substantially driven by their impulses as they belong to the medium-low classes of the society, he is one of the few characters that stand out for their knowledge and studies, and so he tries to dissect his emotions in order to understand them, but the reader can see him slowly descending into the same vortex of all the others, worsen by the affliction of not having the possibilities to seize what he wants and still trying to gain it against all the odds. It is like a lucid madness, an oxymoron, I know, and yet that's the way it felt.I am not giving and higher rating because I found myself often yawing during the novel. The first chapters before the introduction of the main characters, all those lists of people and descriptions of Paris or narration of events that had little to do with the story were well written, of course I could appreciate the technical qualities of them, but, at the end of the day, I just wished they would stop as soon as possibile.Anyway, this is the first book written by V. Hugo that I read, but surely won't be the last. I enjoyed it and I long for the moment I will be finally able to read Les Miserables. Will this summer be the good one? I hope so.
28`3`3.5* - I listened to this on audible and I think the narration of the edition I had chosen spoiled this book for me, somewhat. I chose the unabridged version narrated by Bill Homewood. He was very competent and entertaining but used a lot of high pitched cockney and French accents that grated on me at times and created an almost comedic tone rather than a tragic romance. I did find the story long winded in places (which I don‚Äôt usually mind at all) but loved the setting and story in general. I struggled to feel anything much for the characters and the tragedy unfolding though and I can‚Äôt help put this down to the conflicting tone of the narration. 
29`3`3.5. That ending tho

32`4`922.	Notre-Dame de Paris = Our Lady of Paris = The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Victor HugoThe Hunchback of Notre-Dame is a French Romantic/Gothic novel by Victor Hugo, published in 1831. The story is set in Paris in 1482 during the reign of Louis XI. The gypsy Esmeralda (born as Agnes) captures the hearts of many men, including those of Captain Phoebus and Pierre Gringoire, but especially Quasimodo and his guardian Archdeacon Claude Frollo. Frollo is torn between his obsessive lust for Esmeralda and the rules of Notre Dame Cathedral. He orders Quasimodo to kidnap her, but Quasimodo is captured by Phoebus and his guards, who save Esmeralda. Gringoire, who attempted to help Esmeralda but was knocked out by Quasimodo, is about to be hanged by beggars when Esmeralda saves him by agreeing to marry him for four years. The following day, Quasimodo is sentenced to be flogged and turned on the pillory for one hour, followed by another hour's public exposure. He calls for water. Esmeralda, seeing his thirst, approaches the public stocks and offers him a drink of water. It saves him, and she captures his heart. Later, Esmeralda is arrested and charged with the attempted murder of Phoebus, whom Frollo actually attempted to kill in jealousy after seeing him trying to seduce Esmeralda. She is sentenced to death by hanging. As she is being led to the gallows, Quasimodo swings down by the bell rope of Notre-Dame and carries her off to the cathedral under the law of sanctuary, temporarily protecting her from arrest. Frollo later informs Gringoire that the Court of Parlement has voted to remove Esmeralda's right to the sanctuary so she can no longer seek shelter in the Cathedral and will be taken away to be killed. Clopin, the leader of the Gypsies, hears the news from Gringoire and rallies the citizens of Paris to charge the cathedral and rescue Esmeralda. When Quasimodo sees the Gypsies, he assumes they are there to hurt Esmeralda, so he drives them off. Likewise, he thinks the King's men want to rescue her, and tries to help them find her. She is rescued by Frollo and Gringoire. But after yet another failed attempt to win her love, Frollo betrays Esmeralda by handing her to the troops and watches while she is being hanged. When Frollo laughs during Esmeralda's hanging, Quasimodo pushes him from the height of Notre Dame to his death. Quasimodo goes to the cemetery, hugs Esmeralda's body, and dies of starvation with her. Years later they are discovered and, while trying to separate them, Quasimodo's bones turn to dust.⁄ØŸà⁄òŸæÿ¥ÿ™ ŸÜŸàÿ™ÿ±ÿØÿßŸÖ - Ÿà€å⁄©ÿ™Ÿàÿ± ŸáŸà⁄ØŸà ÿõ ÿßÿØÿ®€åÿßÿ™ ŸÅÿ±ÿßŸÜÿ≥Ÿáÿõ ÿßŸÜÿ™ÿ¥ÿßÿ±ÿßÿ™€åŸáÿß: (ÿ™Ÿàÿ≥ŸÜÿå ÿ≥ÿπ€åÿØ€åÿå ÿπ€åŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá€åÿå ÿ¢ÿ±ŸÖÿßŸÜÿå ÿ®ÿ¥ÿßÿ±ÿ™ÿå ŸÜŸáÿßŸÑ ŸÜŸà€åÿØÿßŸÜÿå ÿßÿ±ÿ∫ŸàÿßŸÜÿå ÿ≥ŸÖŸàÿ±ÿå ÿ≠ŸÇŸàŸÇ€å Ÿà ÿ¨ÿßŸàÿØÿßŸÜ ÿÆÿ±ÿØ)ÿõ ÿ™ÿßÿ±€åÿÆ ŸÜÿÆÿ≥ÿ™€åŸÜ ÿÆŸàÿßŸÜÿ¥: €å⁄©€å ÿßÿ≤ ÿ±Ÿàÿ≤Ÿáÿß€å ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ 1972 ŸÖ€åŸÑÿßÿØ€åÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ: ⁄ØŸà⁄òŸæÿ¥ÿ™ ŸÜŸàÿ™ÿ±ÿØÿßŸÖÿõ ÿßÿ´ÿ±: Ÿà€å⁄©ÿ™Ÿàÿ± ŸáŸà⁄ØŸàÿõ ŸÖÿ™ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÖ: ÿßÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿ≥ÿπ€åÿØ€åÿõ ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå ÿ≥ÿπ€åÿØ€åÿå 1348ÿå ÿØÿ± 242 ÿµÿõ ŸÖŸàÿ∂Ÿàÿπ: ÿØÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜŸáÿß€å ŸÜŸà€åÿ≥ŸÜÿØ⁄ØÿßŸÜ ŸÅÿ±ÿßŸÜÿ≥Ÿà€å - ÿ≥ÿØŸá 19 ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÖ: ÿßÿ≥ŸÅŸÜÿØ€åÿßÿ± ⁄©ÿßŸà€åÿßŸÜÿõ ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿåÿπ€åŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸá€åÿå 1362ÿå ÿØÿ± 309 ÿµÿõ ŸÖÿ™ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÖ: ŸÑŸÇÿß ÿßÿ±ÿØŸÑÿßŸÜÿå ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå ÿßŸÜÿ™ÿ¥ÿßÿ±ÿßÿ™ ÿ™Ÿàÿ≥ŸÜÿõ 1362ÿå ÿØÿ± 108 ÿµÿõ ŸÖÿ™ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÖ: ÿ¨ŸàÿßÿØ ŸÖÿ≠ÿ®€åÿõ ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå ŸÜÿ¥ÿ± ÿ®ÿ¥ÿßÿ±ÿ™ÿå 1370ÿå ÿØÿ± 547 ÿµÿõ ⁄ÜÿßŸæ ÿØŸàŸÖ: ŸÖÿ¥ŸáÿØÿå ÿ¨ÿßŸàÿØÿßŸÜ ÿÆÿ±ÿØÿå 1385ÿõ ÿØÿ± 526 ÿµÿõ ÿ≥ŸàŸÖ 1386ÿõ ⁄ÜŸáÿßÿ±ŸÖ 1387ÿå ŸæŸÜÿ¨ŸÖ 1388ÿõ ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄©: 9789646030282ÿõ ŸÖÿ™ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÖ: ÿß€åÿßÿ≤ ÿ≠ÿØÿßÿØ€åÿõ ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå ÿ¢ÿ±ŸÖÿßŸÜÿå 1370ÿå ÿØÿ± 368 ÿµÿõ ÿØŸàÿ≤ÿ®ÿßŸÜŸá ÿßŸÜ⁄ØŸÑ€åÿ≥€å ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€åÿõ ⁄ÜÿßŸæ ÿ®ÿπÿØ€å 1380ÿõ ÿØÿ± 390 ÿµÿõŸÖÿ™ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÖ: ŸÅÿ™ÿ≠€åŸá ÿµÿßŸÑÿ≠€åÿõ ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå ÿßÿ±ÿ∫ŸàÿßŸÜÿå 1371ÿå ÿØÿ± 128 ÿµÿõ ŸÖÿ™ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÖ: ÿ±Ÿà€åÿß ÿ±€åÿßÿ≠€åÿõ ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå ŸÜÿ¥ÿ± ÿ≥ŸÖŸàÿ±ÿå 1375ÿå ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄©: 9646208193ÿõ ŸÖÿ™ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÖ: ÿ¥⁄©ŸàŸÅŸá ÿßÿÆŸàÿßŸÜÿõ ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå ŸÜŸáÿßŸÑ ŸÜŸà€åÿØÿßŸÜÿå 1375ÿå ÿØÿ± 192 ÿµÿõ ⁄ÜÿßŸæ ÿØ€å⁄Øÿ±: 1392ÿõ ÿØÿ± 159 ÿµÿõ ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄©: 9789645680464ÿõ ŸáŸà⁄ØŸà ÿØÿ± ŸÖŸÇÿØŸÖŸá ⁄©ÿ™ÿßÿ® ŸÖ€åŸÜŸà€åÿ≥ÿØ: ⁄ÜŸÜÿØ ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ Ÿæ€åÿ¥ ŸÜŸà€åÿ≥ŸÜÿØŸá ÿß€åŸÜ ⁄©ÿ™ÿßÿ® ÿ®Ÿá ŸáŸÜ⁄ØÿßŸÖ ÿ™ŸÖÿßÿ¥ÿß €åÿß ÿ®Ÿáÿ™ÿ± ÿ®⁄ØŸà€å€åŸÖ ÿ∂ŸÖŸÜ ⁄©ÿßŸàÿ¥ ÿØÿ± ⁄©ŸÑ€åÿ≥ÿß€å ŸÜÿ™ÿ±ÿØÿßŸÖ ÿØÿ± €å⁄©€å ÿßÿ≤ ÿ≤Ÿàÿß€åÿß€å ÿ™ÿßÿ±€å⁄© ÿ®ÿ±ÿ¨Ÿáÿß€å ÿ¢ŸÜ ⁄©ŸÑŸÖŸá ANATKHÿ±ÿß ⁄©Ÿá ÿØÿ≥ÿ™€å ÿπŸÖ€åŸÇÿßŸã ÿ®ÿ± €å⁄©€å ÿßÿ≤ ÿØ€åŸàÿßÿ±Ÿáÿß ⁄©ŸÜÿØŸá ÿ®ŸàÿØ ŸÖÿ¥ÿßŸáÿØŸá ⁄©ÿ±ÿØ....ÿõ ⁄©ÿ≥€å ⁄©Ÿá ÿß€åŸÜ ⁄©ŸÑŸÖŸá ÿ±ÿß ÿ®ÿ± ÿØ€åŸàÿßÿ± ÿ®ÿ±ÿ¨ ⁄©ŸÑ€åÿ≥ÿß€å ŸÜÿ™ÿ±ÿØÿßŸÖ ŸÜŸÇÿ¥ ÿ≤ÿØŸá ÿ®ŸàÿØ ⁄ÜŸÜÿØ€åŸÜ ÿ≥ÿØŸá Ÿæ€åÿ¥ ÿßÿ≤ ÿ¨ŸáÿßŸÜ ÿ±ÿÆÿ™ ÿ®ÿ±ÿ®ÿ≥ÿ™Ÿáÿå Ÿà ŸÜŸàÿ¥ÿ™Ÿá €å ÿßŸà ŸáŸÖ ÿ®ÿØŸÜÿ®ÿßŸÑ Ÿà€å ŸÜÿßŸæÿØ€åÿØ ⁄Øÿ±ÿØ€åÿØŸáÿå Ÿæÿß€åÿßŸÜ ÿπŸÖÿ± ⁄©ŸÑ€åÿ≥ÿß ŸÜ€åÿ≤ ÿ®ÿ≥€åÿßÿ± ŸÜÿ≤ÿØ€å⁄© ÿßÿ≥ÿ™. ⁄©ÿ™ÿßÿ® ÿ≠ÿßÿ∂ÿ± ÿØÿ±ÿ®ÿßÿ±Ÿá €å ÿ≥ŸÜ⁄Ø ŸÜŸàÿ¥ÿ™Ÿá ŸÖÿ≤ÿ®Ÿàÿ± ÿ®Ÿá ÿ±ÿ¥ÿ™Ÿá €å ÿ™ÿ≠ÿ±€åÿ± ÿØÿ± ÿ¢ŸÖÿØŸá‚Äå ÿßÿ≥ÿ™.ÿõ Ÿæÿß€åÿßŸÜ ŸÜŸÇŸÑ⁄Ü⁄©€åÿØŸá ÿØÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ: ÿØÿ± ¬´Ÿæÿßÿ±€åÿ≥¬ª ÿ≥ÿØŸá ŸæÿßŸÜÿ≤ÿØŸáŸÖÿå ÿØÿÆÿ™ÿ± ⁄©ŸàŸÑ€å ÿ¨ŸàÿßŸÜ Ÿà ÿ≤€åÿ®ÿß€å€åÿå ÿ®Ÿá ŸÜÿßŸÖ: ¬´ÿßÿ≥ŸÖÿ±ÿßŸÑÿØÿß¬ªÿõ ÿ®Ÿá ŸáŸÖÿ±ÿßŸá ÿ®ÿ≤ ÿ®ÿßŸáŸàÿ¥ ÿÆŸàÿØ ŸÖ€åÿ±ŸÇÿµ€åÿØÿå Ÿà ÿ®ÿ±ŸÜÿßŸÖŸá ÿßÿ¨ÿ±ÿß ŸÖ€å⁄©ÿ±ÿØ. ¬´⁄©ŸÑŸàÿØ ŸÅÿ±ŸàŸÑŸà¬ªÿå ÿ±ÿ¶€åÿ≥ ¬´ÿ¥ŸÖÿßÿ≥¬ªŸáÿß€å ¬´ŸÜÿ™ÿ±ÿØÿßŸÖ¬ª ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿå ÿ±ÿßŸáÿ®€å ÿ≥ÿ™ ⁄©Ÿá ÿØÿ± ŸÜŸáÿßŸÜ ÿπÿßÿ¥ŸÇ ¬´ÿßÿ≥ŸÖÿ±ÿßŸÑÿØÿß¬ª ÿ¥ÿØŸá‚Äåÿå ÿßŸà ÿ≥ÿπ€å ŸÖ€å‚Äå⁄©ŸÜÿØ ÿ®ÿß €åÿßÿ±€å ¬´⁄©ÿßÿ≤€åŸÖŸàÿØŸà¬ªÿå ŸÜÿßŸÇŸàÿ≥ ÿ≤ŸÜ ⁄ØŸà⁄òŸæÿ¥ÿ™ÿå Ÿà ÿ®ÿØÿ¥⁄©ŸÑ ¬´ŸÜÿ™ÿ±ÿØÿßŸÖ¬ªÿå ¬´ÿßÿ≥ŸÖÿ±ÿßŸÑÿØÿß¬ª ÿ±ÿß ÿ®ÿ±ÿ®ÿß€åÿØÿå ŸàŸÑ€å ÿ®ÿß ÿØÿÆÿßŸÑÿ™ ¬´⁄©ÿßŸæ€åÿ™ÿßŸÜ ŸÅŸàÿ®Ÿàÿ≥ ÿØŸàÿ¥ÿßÿ™ŸàŸæÿ±¬ª ŸÜÿß⁄©ÿßŸÖ ŸÖ€åŸÖÿßŸÜÿØÿå Ÿà ¬´⁄©ÿßÿ≤€åŸÖŸàÿØŸà¬ª ÿØÿ≥ÿ™⁄Ø€åÿ± ŸÖ€åÿ¥ŸàÿØ. ¬´⁄©ÿßÿ≤€åŸÖŸàÿØŸà¬ª ÿ±ÿß ÿØÿ± ŸÖ€åÿØÿßŸÜ ÿßÿπÿØÿßŸÖÿå ÿ®ÿß ÿ¥ŸÑÿßŸÇ ŸÖÿ¨ÿßÿ≤ÿßÿ™ ŸÖ€å⁄©ŸÜŸÜÿØÿå Ÿà ÿ™ŸÜŸáÿß ¬´ÿßÿ≥ŸÖÿ±ÿßŸÑÿØÿß¬ªÿå ⁄©Ÿá ŸÇŸÑÿ®€å ŸÖŸáÿ±ÿ®ÿßŸÜ ÿØÿßÿ±ÿØÿå ÿ®Ÿá ÿßŸà €åÿßÿ±€å ŸÖ€å‚Äå⁄©ŸÜÿØÿå Ÿà ÿ¨ÿ±ÿπŸá‚Äå ÿß€å ÿ¢ÿ® ÿ®Ÿá ÿßŸà ŸÖ€åÿØŸáÿØ.

33`5`A beautifully romantic story of a one-eyed, deaf, physically deformed, and publicly rejected hero. Love comes in all shapes and sizes though...Quasimodo is ringer of the bells. Although he is now in his twenties, he is deaf due to the clamor of the bells in his ears, day in and day out. Nonetheless, he takes pride in his work, for it is an art to make those bells sing in just such a way as he. And for a man with deformities, he doesn't let it limit him, for he has such an agile body, easily swinging and leaping to and fro. He is fond of his 15 bells, ‚Äúbut big Marie was his favorite‚Äù.After I got about halfway through the book, sometimes frustrated because I wasn't seeing too many scenes about Quasimodo (I mean, he's the titular character, the reason why I'm reading the book, obviously)... I came to the realization that the story just isn't about him. Perhaps we could say the book is about him, but the story itself? It's actually about Esmeralda, the gypsy girl. The common threads running through every chapter... it's all about how it connects with her. And yes, Quasimodo plays a big part in her story.NOTE to the discerning reader & to parents: I'll give you a little caution; there are some ‚Äúmature‚Äù topics alluded to, so for your vivacious younger readers, they may not be ready for it. Plus there's attempted murder, suicidal thoughts, and public hangings. A novel for high-schoolers and adults.This is a story of loss, recovery, hope, treachery, humbleness, redemption, heroism, and not the least of these, love.That ending? I love it. It has to be one of my favorite classic literature endings, ever.
34`3`A challenging read which might not be to everyone‚Äôs taste. Sometimes the narrative appears to be derailed by digressions that are informative but not strictly necessary. The evocation of atmosphere is extremely good. You really feel & see 15th century Paris. The sense of outsiders & alienation is always present, whether caused by birth in the case of the gypsies, by poverty in the case of Gringoire, by vocation in the case of Frollo or image in the case of Quasimodo himself.
35`3`A classic book about love types. Four different lovers to the same naive girl,which ended the story dramatically.Every man loved Esmeralda differently, the selfish one (priest), the lustful one (the captain),the opportunist (the philosopher) and the devoted unselfish one (the hunchback).This story proves that love is blind, and that we mostly love the undeserved.Surely the long description of the places of Paris was so unnecessary that you could skip more than 150 pages from the 640 ones. but it seems that long description is characteristic to all novelist of this era.The plot is very good especially the end of characters :) recommended if you have enough time  
36`2`A classic, for sure, but not my cup of tea. To read about architecture in such minute detail felt quite irrelevant to the story. And a gruesome and somewhat predictable the story was too. If that is the way people actually spoke around that era, I am glad I was not there to witness it first hand üòÖ (far as I remember at least)
37`3`A decent graphic adaptation of a classic novel. If you're too lazy to read Victor Hugo, then this is a good start. There's also some information about the author, the story itself and about Paris (during the times the story is set) at the back of the book, which is a nice bonus :)
38`4`A fantastic story, complex, raw, and truly moving. Characters are so kaleidoscopic, through them we can see different kinds of love, affection, kindness, as well as greed, viciousness, and betrayal. I have to confess that the unabridged version gave me a hard time. The first 100 pages or so I was disheartened, then I skipped the chapters describing the city and became truly immersed on the story. It is not an easy novel to read, but its is definitely worth your while. The only disappointment I had was with the character of Pierre Gringoire, his story was so interesting at the start, but at the end he was reduced to the role of a crazy philosopher who saves Djali.
39`5`A literary masterpiece.
40`3`A litererature masterpiece! Being an architecture student, I enjoyed the thorough descriptions of different places in Paris even though I've never been there. And because frensh is my second language, I enjoyed even more reading the words of Victor Hugo exactly as they were written. But I gotta be honest, I wasn't expecting such a tragedy at all. It was so much darker than I expected, and the end was a little too much for my taste. But it is an amazing classic !
41`4`A parte de ac√ß√£o √© muito interessante e escrita ao melhor estilo dos Romances hist√≥ricos do romantismo, que j√° conhecia dos autores Portugueses (provavelmente tribut√°rios de Victor Hugo e n√£o ao contr√°rio), em que o narrador est√° muito pr√≥ximo do leitor, manda umas piadas, usa uma forma coloquial de comunica√ß√£o, em que o pitoresco de algumas personagens se cruza e equilibra com a profundidade emocional de outras.Mas a parte descritiva de cidades (Paris), monumentos, contexto da sociedade medieval, etc e compara√ß√µes com a contemporaneidade (do autor) s√£o extremamente aborrecidas, at√© porque gastam metade do espa√ßo do livro ou assim parece.Da√≠ s√≥ ter dado 3 estrelas; espero ter motivos, quando acabar de ler o segundo volume, para equilibrar esta classifca√ß√£o.A outra edi√ß√£o do livro que tenho, que n√£o √© integral, como constatei por compara√ß√£o com a que estou a ler, deve ter tido a sabedoria de ter cortado as partes chatas. Mas como prefiro ler textos integrais, vou persistir nesta edi√ß√£o da RBA Editores. 
42`2`A really tough slog for me I found.... maybe I'll try it again in the future, but I really had to push myself to finish this.
43`4`A review I wanted to read this book in light of current events. It is a quick read that is very good and reads easily.
44`4`A tour de force--a melodrama--the stuff of opera--how can one classify Victor Hugo's biography of a work of architecture and of that work's soul, a deformed man with a beautiful heart? The author moves with such a quick, sure foot through the tale with its multiple characters, from beggar to king, that believe him we must, at least with some part of our being. It is not a work to analyze, but certainly one to live.
45`5`AWESOME STUFF.
46`3`Actual Rating: 3.5 StarsIt's always something of a challenge for me to review classics. Most of the time I can easily see why these books are so revered and can agree that they deserve the accolades that they receive, however, depending on when and how they are written they are not always the most enjoyable books to read. This is true for The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. There is definitely a lot to love about this book. I feel like I learned more about Victor Hugo from this book than I did when I read Les Miserables. He displays his passion for the architecture of Notre-Dame and it's clear that he wrote this book at least in part to showcase it and to help preserve it. His opinions on the justice system are also abundantly clear. There are moments when he is almost snarky in his narration when describing the faults with the French justice system (Is it possible for a 19th century romantic author to be snarky?). His characters have also withstood the test of time. It's impossible not to have sympathy for Quasimodo. I also enjoyed the character of Pierre (a caricature of an actual historical figure) just because he was so implausible (the man has more affection for a goat than most of the other people he comes in contact with). Claude Frollo is an especially despicable character and to this day he still comes across as creepy and menacing. I think every woman has had an interaction with some scary guy who won't take no for an answer. Frollo is the worst possible example of this type of character. That being said, this book has some moments that are tough to get through. Some of the sections on architecture can be a bit dry. Also, and I'm not sure if if this is a stylistic trait of the era, the dialogue can go on and on in a few sections. Frollo spent pages throwing himself at Esmeralda and Sister Gudule spent a lot of time bemoaning the loss of her child. This book has some beautiful themes that the romantic era is famous for. It's not a happy story (Don't let Disney fool you! This book can be a bit depressing at times). But like most of Hugo's works, it does make you think about the human condition and showcases the city of Paris.
47`5`After Leroux's "Phantom of the Opera", the next big surprise for me coming from classical French literature.
48`5`After a very slow start (of 200 pages), the ending makes for a memorable book.
49`3`After enjoying the sights of Paris from atop one of the Notre Dame cathedrals a few years ago, after enjoying Disney‚Äôs stage adaptation of this story, and after seeing the shocking images of the medieval cathedral ablaze last spring, I finally set out to read Victor Hugo‚Äôs classic work ‚ÄúNotre-Dame de Paris‚Äù (better known in English as ‚ÄúThe Hunchback of Notre Dame‚Äù).Set in 1482, Hugo‚Äôs novel tells of a time period with which I am not very familiar. However, he spends multiple pages laying out the city and setting for the reader ‚Äî so much so that I got somewhat lost in the descriptions of Paris and struggled to understand why he included so much description. And therein lies my one complaint with this novel: its copious descriptions tended to distract rather than enlighten me. The story itself, however, was quite interesting and tells a tale unlike most of today‚Äôs stories in that its ending was quite dark. Contrary to Hugo‚Äôs other famous work, Les Mis√©rables, this novel lacks redemption entirely. By the end, the two characters I sympathized with were unnecessarily dead, the character I hated was rightfully dead, and the last guy ‚Äî the good-looking jock type named Phoebus ‚Äî ‚Äúlikewise came to a tragic end ‚Äî he married‚Äù (497). Maybe it‚Äôs from having been raised in the golden era of Disney‚Äôs animated classics, but I really wanted Esmeralda to live. Truly, the poor girl didn‚Äôt deserve any of the tragedy thrown at her (a theme that, I suppose, most humans feel they can relate to). And the hunchback Quasimodo also didn‚Äôt deserve his barrage of ill treatment ‚Äî but what depth and insight Hugo brings to the sad reality that our image and the way others see us bring about great levels of pride or shame. Ultimately, this novel pales in comparison to the brilliance of Les Mis√©rables (the only two of Hugo‚Äôs novels that I‚Äôve read), but it does pose some philosophically challenging questions amid the beauty of one of the world‚Äôs most magnificent cathedrals. And for that alone, I feel this classic is worth reading.
50`3`Although I enjoyed the story as a whole, I was a bit bored by some of it. I guess the edition I read may have had additional chapters in it.
51`5`Amazing book! Loved the author's view on things. I really felt like I was getting glimpses of a great mind by reading this book. You might want to read it with a highlighter for good quotes. I'm reading Les Miserable right now and again I really like Victor Hugo's writing. There are times where he really goes into depth about history, or something and it is hard to read but if you can get past those parts you will thank yourself because he has some great writing.
52`4`At least a quarter of this book is about the buildings and architecture of Paris in 1842 and Quasimodo is actually the only likable character.
53`3`At times very riveting, but mostly slow and ponderous. And I feel that Hugo takes far too many tangents along the way that slow down the momentum of the narrative.
54`3`Audiobook:The narration was brilliant, however, the story itself is tragic in so very many ways. The writing is good, but the plot is depressing with little let up.
55`5`Beautiful, witty, gripping, tragic. Definitely no happy ending in this original version. The symbolism in this book is profound; the moral, timeless. Truly a book the will last through the ages.There is an insightful note added in this book by the author: "We must, if possible, inspire the nation with a love of its national architecture... that is one of the chief aims of this book..."Hugo had on more than one occasion pleaded and spoken out loudly against many profanations, demolitions, and impieties done on old architecture. How many other classic writers had taken a cause such as this in their works? 
56`4`Beautiful. So so wordy (as one would expect from Victor Hugo), but beautiful none the less. The contrast of being hated for beauty and being hated for being hideous as personified in the characters in La Esmeralda and Quasimodo was so overwhelming. The stunning imagery of the beautiful yet cracked crystal holding wilted flowers versus the common jug holding fresh flowers was so striking in this, my second reading of this book.This particular audiobook rendition wasn't fantastic. I found the different voices the narrator used not fitting with my preconceived voice for certain characters. The female voices in particular bothered me. I'm sure there are other versions out there.
57`5`Before reading this book, it's important to remember that the original title was Notre-Dame de Paris; Notre Dame itself plays the central and foundational role, and the hunchback dwells within it as much as his character simply inhabits the book. Hugo builds a story that comments both subtly and explicitly on the inevitability of fate, the forward march of time and the results of this, the surmounting of one art form over another (literature conquers architecture as the medium representing human ideas and ideals), and the crossroads‚Äîor lack thereof‚Äîof religion and life.Perhaps the most impressive accomplishment of this book is the construction of Paris as both the physical setting and the core of the story's themes. Underneath and throughout the story, Paris stands as a symbol of a victim of time; described as if viewed from the rooftop of Notre Dame, it is recreated as it was "then" versus its deteriorated condition "now" (in 1830). It's a city contained in a book.
58`null`Bind 1 av 2.
59`3`Books like this one really get me to dig more and more in to the book until i reach to the end. I had chosen this one as a random book to read and i really loved it. It helped me pass my time when i had nothing to do at all. My favorite character from this book is La Esmeralda and obviously the main guy, the Hunchback.
60`null`Bought this edition in Paris after visiting Norte-Dame 5 months ago (11/2018).
61`5`By far the best classic I've ever read. This story is dark, with odd snippets of humor. The characters are all deeply obsessed with each other which brings out both the best and worst in humanity. An excellent classic and an excellent read.
62`null`Can't remember the last time I dnf-ed a book this fast. The plot probably hasn't even started but wow, is this boring and difficult to get through or what? Sorry, Hugo, maybe another time since I own the book anyway.
63`2`Chances are you've heard of this story set in medieval Paris. "In the vaulted Gothic towers of Notre-Dame lives Quasimodo, the hunchbacked bell-ringer. Mocked and shunned for his appearance, he is pitied only by Esmerelda, a beautiful gypsy dancer to whom he becomes completely devoted. Esmerelda, however, has also attracted the attention of the sinister archdeacon Claude Frollo, and when she rejects his lecherous approaches, Frollo hatches a plot to destroy her, which only Quasimodo can prevent. Victor Hugo's sensational, evocative novel brings life to the medieval Paris he loved, and mourns its passing in on of the greatest historical romances of the nineteenth century." That's the description on the back of my copy (from Penguin Classics.)I really enjoyed the plot of this book. I did. But parts of the book are so overwritten, with big overarching descriptions. I really DON'T CARE. Get on with the story already, Hugo. As the back of the book says, he does compare medieval Paris favorably to nineteenth century Paris. And that was sort of interesting to read. You can tell Hugo was one of those people who was born too late.The parts of Notre-Dame de Paris where there was dialogue and action were really great and interesting. But just when the story started to pick up, there was another long descriptive chapter, which was really off-putting. Hugo does capture the atmosphere of the period well though. And as I said, the actual story is just fine. In fact, the story is great. It's just the writing style which made it hard to get through. But I'm still going to give this one 3.5 stars, because parts of were good.
64`1`Class read this in 7th grade French Immersion. Then I ran into it again in 11th grade French at an English school. They had us read it ourselves in 7th grade, whereas we read it as a class for the 11th grade courseLogistics aside, I once got to have some escargot outside of Notre Dame. My mother actually went up the stairs. I wasn't so keen on sightseeing
65`5`Couldn't believe that the cute, dancing goat wasn't a Disney addition. I cried and cried at the end.
66`1`DNF at page 134I'm a bit disappointed by this. Honestly, this is the only Hugo book that I have a huge interest in reading. Sure, I'll give Les Mis a try, but I'm not into that story. But, this one? To this day, the Disney movie is the only movie that I can actually finish and get over the halfway through boring stuff. This book just didn't do it for me. It's a love letter to Notre Dame. I just felt my eyes glazing over as I read the multitude of descriptions. And the characters? Nothing to say about them, really. They were second fiddle to the church.
67`5`Dark, brooding, devilishly eloquent, powerfully moving. I won't ever forget the scene where Quasimodo rescues Esmerelda crying "sanctuary!" I can't believe it took me so long to read this book. Surprisingly sultry for a 19th century novel.
68`5`Decided to read this after reading Les Miserables. Not as good as Les Mis but a close second! I found myself audible gasping and laughing at passages. I‚Äôm glad I read the abridged version. I have a new appreciation for Notre Dame and Paris!
69`3`Definition of a tragedy.
70`5`Disney lied to us :(
71`5`Disney lied to us.‚Ä¶Let me specify.You probably guessed that Victor Hugo‚Äôs novel does not have dancing gargoyles or Wizard of Oz references, but it goes much deeper than that. In fact, we can trace its primary misdirection back to whoever first decided on the English translation of the title of the book: The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. This implies that the main character of the story is Quasimodo, the misformed outcast with a heart of gold who longs .to spend oooone daaay ooouuut theeeeere.. However, Hugo‚Äôs original French title is much more accurate: Notre-Dame de Paris. This focus of the novel is on its setting rather than its protagonists ‚Äì we follow a cast of characters, but in the end, all roads lead to the cathedral..Read More.
72`3`Dramatic yet enjoyable. I wasn't dissapointed after reading it. But if you go into the novel expecting it to be like the movies that have attempted to describe the story of Quasimodo, you may be surprised/disappointed. The movies don't give it justice. Overall, Victor Hugo wrote a great novel with great emotion and depicted a true vision of human tendencies and behaviors.
73`3`El libro se pone bueno a partir del libro 9, el final no es igual al que vi en las caricaturas u_u
74`5`En ce dimanche de P√¢ques et sous le feu encore br√ªlant de l‚Äôactualit√© concernant l‚Äôincendie de ¬´¬†Notre-Dame de Paris¬†¬ª, ce magnifique t√©moin de la capitale qui a connu les flammes dans la soir√©e du 15 avril 2019, un √©difice dont Victor Hugo avait √©crit un ouvrage, voici le moment venu d‚Äôen parler un peu, malgr√© les nombreuses critiques √©logieuses d√©j√† publi√©es. Je me bornerai donc √† une petite participation pour apporter mon obole.Pendant que toutes les cloches de ma ville (et d‚Äôailleurs) carillonnent avec celles venues de Rome pour l‚Äôoccasion, c‚Äôest √† ce fabuleux roman que je pense, un grand classique de la litt√©rature fran√ßaise que Victor Hugo a √©crit en six mois sous la pression de son √©diteur. Pour ce faire, il n‚Äôest pas sorti de chez lui afin de satisfaire la demande. L‚Äô√©mission hebdomadaire de ¬´¬†La Grande Librairie¬†¬ª du 19 avril dernier s‚Äôest faite dans l‚Äôurgence et a ¬´¬†chamboul√©¬†¬ª son programme pour √©voquer ¬´¬†Notre-Dame de Paris¬†¬ª¬†: Ken Follett avait fait sp√©cialement le d√©placement ‚Äì Fran√ßois Cheng √©tait venu √©galement ainsi que d‚Äôautres √©crivains (dont un dessinateur talentueux qui a, entre autres, dessin√© une Esmeralda qui survolait la cath√©drale) - sans parler d‚Äôartistes qui ont lu des textes.Pour ma part, je dois reconna√Ætre que ce livre est un livre tr√®s ancien ‚Äì je l‚Äôai lu et relu de tr√®s nombreuses fois ‚Äì il est rest√© pr√©sent √† mon esprit car il fait partie des chefs-d‚Äô≈ìuvre que l‚Äôon ne peut pas oublier.Les personnages principaux y sont¬†: bien s√ªr la belle Esmeralda (une danseuse boh√©mienne qui vit dans la Cour des Miracles - elle repr√©sente la vie libre, fantasque, elle est le charme, la beaut√© et sa ch√®vre, Djali l‚Äôaccompagne)) ‚Äì Quasimodo (le bossu, le sonneur de cloches, terriblement laid mais amoureux de Esmeralda) ‚Äì le superbe Phoebus (un archer qui intervient pour tenter de sauver la belle) ‚Äì l‚Äôarchidiacre Frollo (lui aussi amoureux fou de Esmeralda) ‚Äì le pauvre Gringoire (qui se retrouve en pleine Cour des Miracles, conduit devant le roi des Thunes et qui doit mourir √† moins qu‚Äôune femme veuille bien l‚Äô√©pouser¬†; c‚Äôest Esmeralda qui le prend en piti√© et devient sa femme platonique).De cet ouvrage tomb√© dans le domaine public mais qui resurgit avec le sinistre effroyable survenu dans ce monument qui se dresse avec majest√© depuis huit si√®cles √† Paris, mais qui, meurtri, reste debout, je dois avouer que je l‚Äôai trouv√© passionnant. J‚Äôai revu toutes les gargouilles ‚Äì tout ce que l‚Äôon pouvait visiter quand j‚Äôy suis all√©e ‚Äì la magnificence et la colossale structure avec ses beffrois‚Ä¶¬´¬†Notre-Dame de Paris¬†¬ª, tu as √©t√© gri√®vement bless√©e mais tu as gard√© bien des tr√©sors et, des cendres, vont rena√Ætre d‚Äôautres √©l√©ments √† ta gloire.Il y a, heureusement, de beaux restes avec le travail de ¬´¬†Viollet-le-Duc, l‚Äôarchitecte qui r√©inventa Notre-Dame¬†¬ª au XIXe si√®cle en se r√©f√©rant au Moyen-√Çge.

Tu as √©galement √©t√© bien utile √† notre Sylvain Tesson qui t‚Äôa escalad√©e de nombreuses fois et qui dit que tu lui a sauv√© la vie‚Ä¶De ce bel ouvrage qu‚Äôest ¬´¬†Notre-Dame de Paris¬†¬ª de Victor Hugo, qui a travers√© bien de nombreuses ann√©es et que l‚Äôon consulte tant de fois car il est inoubliable, c‚Äôest avec un grand plaisir que l‚Äôon s‚Äôy plonge car il est tout simplement envo√ªtant ‚Äì non seulement par le touchant roman d‚Äôamour ‚Äì mais aussi par la folie ‚Äì un peu d‚Äôhumour qu‚Äôa gliss√© l‚Äôauteur avec, par exemple, les femmes habill√©es en bourgeoises et d√©crivant leurs tenues vestimentaires.¬´¬†Notre-Dame de Paris¬†¬ª a √©t√© et restera un beau roman historique ainsi que romanesque ‚Äì un classique parmi les classiques dont a √©t√© tir√©e une jolie com√©die musicale ainsi qu‚Äôune belle chanson (qui me trotte dans la t√™te) ‚Äì une ≈ìuvre d‚Äôun g√©nie qui l‚Äôa √©crite √† l‚Äô√¢ge de vingt-neuf ans‚Ä¶.Que dire de plus et qui n‚Äôa pas √©t√© d√©j√† dit¬†? C‚Äôest bien difficile. Une histoire o√π se succ√®dent tant d‚Äô√©v√©nements, de catastrophes ‚Äì une fin tragique‚Ä¶J‚Äôajouterai seulement que c‚Äôest un r√©cit bouleversant malgr√© son √¢ge (et dire que je n‚Äôaime pas les histoires d‚Äôamour mais ici elle est bien particuli√®re) et que les cloches continuent √† sonner pour la saluer √† sa juste valeur. Un autre trait particulier est que ce r√©cit a √©t√© imm√©diatement associ√© √† La Esmeralda (qui en espagnol signifie ¬´¬†√©meraude¬†¬ª.)Pour moi cela reste une perle bien pr√©cieuse.Mais je parlais d‚Äôune certaine chanson, celle de la com√©die musicale, chant√©e par Garou¬†¬†: ¬´¬†Quand les ann√©es auront pass√© / On retrouvera sous terre / Nos squelettes enlac√©s / Pour dire √† l'univers / Combien Quasimodo aimait / Esm√©ralda la zingara / Lui qui Dieu avait fait si laid /Pour l'aider √† porter sa croix / Mangez mon corps, buvez mon sang / Vautours de Montfaucon / Que la mort au-del√† du temps / Unisse nos deux noms / Laissez mon √¢me s'envoler / Loin des mis√®res de la terre / Laisser mon amour se m√™ler / A la lumi√®re de l'Univers / Danse mon Esm√©ralda / (‚Ä¶) / Laisse moi partir avec toi / Mourir pour oit n'est pas mourir / Danse mon Esmeralda / Chante mon Esmeralda ...¬†¬ªEn conclusion ultime, je m‚Äôaper√ßois que j‚Äôai non seulement un peu parl√© de l‚Äôouvrage mais aussi de la cath√©drale parmi les cath√©drales, qui, telle un Ph√©nix va rena√Ætre de ses cendres et je lui ai, ainsi, rendu un petit hommage.
75`4`Esmeralda is actually pretty boring. Frollo is surprisingly more sympathetic than expected. Quasimoto is, in comparison, rather roughly sketched as a person. Verdict: good but not great.
76`5`Esmeralda is one of my favorite literary characters. My favorite bits are the paragraphs relating to her; the sentences were so gorgeous that it took my breath away. Victor was not accepted by older audiences during his time, but the youth worshiped him. He was a Pisces, like me...perhaps that's why I enjoy his writing!
77`5`Este libro me ha encantado, es un libro de V√≠ctor Hugo y adem√°s tiene ilustraciones de Benjamin Lacombe y es genial....... me encanta. Adem√°s tengo que decir que esta edici√≥n est√° muy currada. La historia es chul√≠sima y tengo que reconocer que no me lo esperaba fue un regalo y me encanta.
78`4`Everything in The Hunchback of Notre-Dame is a fascinating juxtaposition of the grotesque and the sublime ‚Äì the speech, the characters, the setting. I felt like the whole point of the story was to show that architecture was the only good thing that came from the Middle Ages so for heaven‚Äôs sake, don‚Äôt tear those buildings down! We could never build something like that again! This book saved the Notre Dame Cathedral by giving people a reason to care about it and showing how Gothic architecture was beautiful even though it was different (which is a theme in the novel that applies to the characters as well). Victor Hugo likes lists that are very, very long full of even longer names and I found myself falling asleep a lot in the first half of the book. Then suddenly I get hit over the head by this steamy, passionate, action-packed, gruesomely violent second half of the novel complete with forbidden love. Didn‚Äôt see that coming. I found it surprisingly modern in that there are a lot elements in this story that are popular in novels, especially young adult ones, today. Though I can‚Äôt help but think that the girl would have been turned on by the whole forbidden/creepy love thing if it had been written today instead of her being horrified by it. And can I just say how shocked I was when he used the word ‚Äúvampire‚Äù AND talked about Nicolas Flamel? There was some great sarcastic humor in here that had me smiling. This was Hugo‚Äôs first novel after writing plays and it reads like one. There are lots of action scenes and he writes an excellent mob. He almost makes me want to grab a pitchfork. I walked away from this book thinking about what beauty and love really are.This book is also reviewed on my blog Books: A true story
79`5`Excelente libro! Una historia que todos conocemos, con bellas ilustraciones y una traducci√≥n f√°cil y sencilla. Para aquellas personas que les gusta la arquitectura, el autor proporciona unas descripciones y unas criticas en este campo que resultan interesantes y a la vez enriquecedoras.
80`3`Felt longer than it needed to be. Some really good parts, but others painfully slow. Overall, just glad to be done.
81`4`First of all, forget everything you think you know about this story based on Disney films or other adaptions. This is a horrid account of death in the stylings of Shakespearean tragedy offset by brilliant and imaginitive prose.Victor Hugo craftily employs character contrast, metaphor, split narrative, etc to render "Hunchback". Without going to much into detail, I will say these are merely devices by which Hugo drafts the misunderstandings and tragedy that would ensue through the story: Esmerelda misunderstanding Phoebus' "love" and being wrongly accused for a death that did not happen, Claude Frollo misunderstanding how to express love and how to fill the void left in its absence, the parentage of several characters, the King's orders without proper information, etc.Quasimodo seems to be the only character in tune with his own quality, as ugly and mis-shapen as he is. And thusly, like the great cathedral herself, he watches this all unfold and reacts in a fairly dumb, child-like fashion. The final events of the story could have all been avoided had certain social or cultural qualities been eliminated, which is, I'm sure, Hugo's point.It is a fantastic read, but be warned - you will not put the book down feeling good about...anything.
82`3`Flip ahead to the middle, when Hug-o finally starts talking about the core characters I was hoping to read about: Frollo, Quasimodo, and Esmeralda. The action scenes were well done and vivid, but there's also a lot of drudgery to skip. The ending was intense. I am curious to see how the Disney film "compares" to the original. ;)
83`4`Forget Disney. This was exasperating! Can't believe I still have teeth after all the gnashing. What a thrilling delivery. Hugo, bravo!
84`5`Formidable ‚ù§Ô∏è
85`4`God. I should've stayed with Disney's version.
86`5`Goodness, is this novel quite different to Disney's film! That was my first thought when I read this book for the first time, and in this my second time round I still am baffled at how they managed to make this tragic story into a children's happy-ending-for-all tale. Oh, I sure know now, they changed most of it and sanitised the plot, that's how.To me, this was one of those books that I end up liking for the story more than for the characters, which doesn't happen that often because of my reading tastes. Maybe it's that the characters are rather archetypical and too well inserted into a niche to be likable by themselves what made me focus on the story instead: Esmeralda is kind but too na√Øve and foolish for her own good, Claude Frollo is the textbook definition of a professional creeper, his younger brother Jehan is the quintaessential ne'er-do-well college student, Phoebus is your average egotistical ass, and Gringoire is a coward (When you care more about a goat than about the girl who saved your life...). Hugo doesn't make it easy to enjoy the story itself at times, with his tendency to meander and be overwordy, but once one gets used to this style, the tale is quite good. 
87`5`Grandiose, √©pique, extr√™mement romantique (malgr√© quelques chapitres sur l'architecture parisienne, que j'ai appr√©ci√©s pour leur valeur √©ducative, mais dont je ne suis pas certaine de bien saisir la place dans la narration...). Pour un lecteur moderne, la stupidit√© d'Esmeralda r√©clame cependant un tout petit peu de second degr√© (oui, √† l'√©poque, c'√©tait √ßa, une jeune fille parfaitement pure et vertueuse... une lectrice moderne a quand m√™me bien envie de lui dire que personne ne l'oblige √† tomber amoureuse de Quasimodo, mais qu'au bout de 6 mois qu'il a pass√© √† s'occuper d'elle, elle pourrait peut-√™tre commencer √† envisager de ne plus √™tre terroris√©e parce qu'il est bossu ?). Le discours sous-jacent sur la peine de mort, implicitement d√©crite comme une pratique m√©di√©vale et barbare dont il est urgent que le peuple ach√®ve de se d√©barrasser, est par contre beaucoup plus actuel. 
88`4`Great story. Slow at start and if you're not interested in semi-philosophical monologues/rants then it's an even slower beginning (I liked those though so it did not bring down my score).The church of Notre Dame was in decay in the 19th century when Victor Hugo wrote the book and most people thought the church should be demolished. The book became so successful that it brought interest back to the church and eventually saved it.I much recommend this book for those mostly familiar with the Disney version of Hunchback of ND, since a lot was changed to fit the modern style of villain vs hero and how love always finds a way and wins. The motives driving the characters are somewhat different from the Disney film, making it enjoyable to read since I didn't know how the plot would turn.
89`5`Having been to Notre Dame in Paris made this so much more interesting as there is much discussion on the surroundings and architecture. More specifically, there are many sections of the book where Quasimoto or the archdeacon are standing high atop the cathedral looking down the river Seine. It is so easy to imagine those scenes after being there.It is a highly intriguing story by an immensely talented author. I give it five stars mostly because of Hugo's ability. However, it does not compete with Les Miserables (there aren't many novels that do) that was written quite a few years (30) later. I would highly recommend it.
90`5`Heart-wrenching, soul-examining, take-me-away storytelling. Stick through Hugo‚Äôs slightly eccentric side tracks and you‚Äôll find this well worth your time.
91`5`Hello everybody.I'm new on this site and this is my first review. I'm also a foreigner and English is my second language so please don't judge me too hard :)In November I did a presentation about Notre-Dame de Paris for my history project at school. In my project i mentioned Victor Hugo's book called "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame" because this novel has affected on the cathedral's history and destiny. When I was doing the presentation at home, my mum saw that I mentioned this book on one of the slides of my presentation. She said that she had read it and she had really liked it, so she recommended it to me. I started reading this book few weeks later.About the bookI was reading it for a long time because the book is very hard to read. The novel has got a lot of descriptions and history moments and that's why it was a little bit boring sometimes (for example, the whole third part consists of the cathedral's and Paris description). But the plot of "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame" is really exciting. Sometimes I couldn't stop reading and my heart beaten very-very fast. Especially when I was reading Claude and la Esmeralda's dialogues which are more Claude's monologues...My favourite characters1. Claude FrolloI don't know why I like him so much. I know that he is a very bad character and he deserves his death. He is very cruel and scary. He is the reason of la Esmeralda's death from the very beginning: I mean, from that moment, when he tried to kill Phoebus and then he ran away. While I was reading the first chapters, I thought that he was a good character and I liked him. He is VERY clever and he is passionate about science. He is kind (well, it seemed to me that he is kind because he took care of Quasimodo when other people wanted to burn that baby only because of his ugliness). He loves his brother and he does everything for him. He never cares about people's opinion. So, because of all these characteristics I decided that Claude Frollo was a GREAT character.Then Claude fell in love with la Esmeralda... And his life became COMPLETELY different. ¬´When one has an idea, one encounters it in everything.‚Äù‚ÄúI know that,‚Äù replied the archdeacon.¬ªClaude almost forgot about science. He turned away from Quasimodo. And in the end of the book he even let his brother die. "Because of her". Claude's love is really crazy. It is completely different from Quasimodo's love which is pure and innocent and Phoebus's love which is not really deep and fleeting. Claude's love is disastrous. He became so mad because of his love that he decided to kill his lover. When he thought that la Esmeralda was dead it even became easier to live for him. 2. QuasimodoI suppose that he is the only good character in "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame" (la Esmeralda is not a good character for me). He is so beautiful inside even though he is ugly outside. He understands that la Esmeralda doesn't love him and she will never do this. But he still does everything for her. He stands for a whole day near Fleur-de-Lys house because la Esmeralda wants him to do this, because he just wants her to be happy. I think that people like him can't stand the cruel world they live in and they always hide somewhere. For example, Quasimodo was hiding in the cathedral for his whole life and during this time his only friends were the bells in Notre-Dame de Paris. 3. Pier GrenguarYeah, I know thai he is cowardly and pathetic but. He. Is. Just. Sooo. Funny. I was laughing at him during the whole book. He is the funniest character in the novel (the other funny character is the king). And his quotes are great, though. Why i can't say that la Esmeralda is a good character?I don't think that la Esmeralda is a good character because she seems very silly to me. She falls in love not with a person but with the sword and the uniform.¬´Twas of you that I was dreaming, before I knew you, my Phoebus; the officer of my dream had a beautiful uniform like yours, a grand look, a sword; your name is Phoebus; ‚Äôtis a beautiful name. I love your name; I love your sword. Draw your sword, Phoebus, that I may see it.¬ªAnd she doesn't even feel gratitude to Quazimado. She can't feel it because of his ugliness. It' even written in the book about it (sorry, I lost that moment in the novel...). La Esmeralda doesn't see the soul. She sees only the appearance. And that's why I don't like her. Of course I feel sorry for her. She didn't deserve her destiny. She died because of the crime she's never committed. She understood who her mother was RIGHT BEFORE her death. And she died thinking that Phoebus loved her. But maybe that's even better for her... She was too unhappy to know the truth. My favourite quotes from "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame"¬´Nothing touches when it comes from the man whom one does not love¬ª (The best quote, in my opinion). ¬´What has become of Phoebus?‚Äù she repeated coldly.‚ÄúHe is dead!‚Äù cried the priest.‚ÄúDead!‚Äù said she, still icy and motionless ‚Äúthen why do you talk to me of living"?¬ª¬´Alas! human actions are taken by two handles. That is branded with disgrace in one which is crowned in another.¬ªThere were more quotes that I liked but unfortunately I didn't mark them and now I lost them :(ConclusionI loved the book really much. I'd recommend it to people who love mind-wrecking, hard-to-read but exciting books, people who love books with no happy ending, and, of course, to french literature fans. To middle age french literature fans. Like me. 
92`4`Hi, am I a huge sucker for Victor Hugo even though objectively the man rambles so much it should be enough to drive me to distraction? Somehow I still love it? "This Will Kill That" was surprisingly one of my absolute fave chapters and I'm so glad Hugo wrote it in there!! I LOVED the asides about his perspective on architecture and although the story is slow to begin due to the constant tangents (it was rough but persevere bc #worthit), it really picked up and I fell a little in tragic tragic love with the story. I never warmed up to Gringore because he was pretty pathetic but the sheer SCOPE of the other characters went a long way in my opinion. The one thing that truly drove me up the wall was that in the edition I read (this one), the translator had left a lot of sayings either untranslated or unexplained - which is fine! except the footnotes she made for that were al at the back of the book rather than at the bottom of the page so I had to keep flicking back and forth all the time which was so annoying. I'd rather have half a page of footnotes that I can just flick down to then having to find which page the specific note was on all the time :P Some of the time I just guessed what was being said from context because I just couldn't be bothered. But that's my one quibble and although for me it interrupted to flow of the reading, it in no way negated my experience of reading. 
93`4`Historian, Philosopher and PoetIf I can quote one passage from Hugo's books that best reflects the author, the focus of his passions, the style and architecture of his novels, it would be the following:"There he was, serious, motionless, absorbed - all eye, all ear, all thought. All Paris was at his feet, with the thousand spires of its buildings, and its circular horizon of gentle hills, with its river winding beneath its bridges and its people pouring through its streets, its cloud of smoke, and its mountain chain of roofs crowding close to Notre-Dame with their double slopes of mail. In this whole city the Archdeacon's eye sought just one point of the pavement, the Place du Parvis, and among the whole multitude just one figure, the Bohemian."Hugo referred to himself as a historian, philosopher and poet. He studied history, contemplated human destiny, and expressed his ideals through his writings, i.e., through the struggles and voices of his heroes, for whom he prepared the whole world and history as the grand stage.Ecce Notre-Dame, Ecce HomoThis book can be divided into four Parts, like four movements of a symphony, with mini climaxes in the second and third movement.Part I: Festival of Fools (Book I-II)Hugo introduces all the main characters in the dramatic setting of a festival in the streets of Paris in 1482. It's in the late Middle Ages, a year before the birth of Martin Luther. One of the characters is a poet, who is the thread that runs through the entire novel and at whose expense Hugo showcases his self-deprecating humor.Part II: Ecce Notre-Dame (Book III-V)The view zooms out, so to speak, and Hugo describes a bird's-eye view of Paris and its history as immortalized in its architecture, the centerpiece of which is Notre-Dame de Paris. Here is the most beautiful chapter of the book, a symphonic description of the life and architecture of Paris.To paraphrase Hugo, Notre-Dame is the expression of the world. Its architecture, a transition from Roman style with its low circular arches and heavy pillars to Gothic style with its pointed arches, is a reflection of the progress of society since ancient times, from unity and hierarchy to democracy and freedom.Hugo proclaims, "Architecture is dead". Architecture, as a means of expression for mankind, will be replaced by printing, which is cheaper and more convenient, and therefore provides more freedom of expression. If Hugo were alive today, he would perhaps predict that digital media would replace their analog counterpart, e.g. electronic books would replace printed books, and something like Wikipedia would be the new Tower of Babel.Part III: Ecce Homo (Book VI-VIII)After setting the historical stage, Hugo zooms in on the main character of the novel, i.e., the human face of Notre-Dame, the Archdeacon and the bell-ringer. To me, they are one person. The physical deformity of the latter illustrates the spiritual deformity of the former, and the residual tender loving-kindness in the former is magnified in the latter. (If I might add, a similar device is used in Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and The Picture of Dorian Gray.)The conflict is unrequited love. The Archdeacon's passionate but deadly lust for the Bohemian girl, the bell-ringer's tender but primitive devotion to her, and the Bohemian girl's love for her idol. In contrast, there are also exhilarating moments when love triumphs over lust, over baseness and over the condemning laws. When the ugly and pitiable becomes august and beautiful.However, there is a deeper meaning underneath the conflict of unrequited love, and that's the reason, I think, why the book was once banned by the Catholic Church.The Archdeacon represents the Church, more specifically, the religious hierarchy and laws of the Church, and the Bohemian girl, the unbeliever. The Church pursues the unbeliever, but because the religious laws bring nothing but shackles and death, the latter shrinks from him and pursues her own idol, Phoebus "the Sun god". This is made poignantly manifest when the Archdeacon claimed that only he could save the Bohemian from death and demanded her to choose between him and gallows, and she chose the latter.Part IV: The Siege of Notre-Dame (Book IX-XI)Finally, the view returns to the bigger stage, when the tension between hierarchy and freedom mingled with lawlessness becomes unbearable, there broke out the siege of the Notre-Dame, a figure of the siege of the Bastille. Ironically, the siege was instigated by the Archdeacon himself and the poet, signifying that revolts against the Church have their roots in its own corruption through lust. Alas, there was no freedom or deliverance except through death.
94`3`Honestamente, estoy muy decepcionada. La verdad que, al menos en este tomo, hubo demasiados cap√≠tulos enteros dedicados a hablar de arquitectura. Lleg√≥ un punto en que se volvi√≥ insoportable, y siento que se pierde el hilo de la historia. Me cost√≥ mucho terminarlo, aunque la historia promete ser interesante. Vamos a ver qu√© pasa en el segundo volumen.Suma una estrella porque me encantan los dibujos de Benjamin Lacombe, es fant√°stico!
95`5`How I'm sorry I didn't read it after being in Paris. I would still have the it fresh in my mind even if 1482 Paris is a very different city from the one we're able to enjoy today. But in this book Victor Hugo takes us by the hand and show us that city and its incredible buildings, mainly Notre Dame (which actually left me in love with it when I went there, is just gorgeous and the view is breath taking).The book is a bit slow, very descriptive, but once the story picks up and you see Fate unraveling, Destiny becomes something tangible and you can't turn away your gaze. And it's like watching a train wreck.I loved the characters, how each one was able of such different types of love for the same person and how that love in some ways consumed them. How love seems so similar to desire, how liking beautiful things is in a way superfluous and maybe confused with love. And the ending... It reminded me of The Phantom of the Opera. Seems like Paris has a great deal of disfigured characters that haunt buildings and are in love with beautiful girls. :P~*~Ah, pegar em cl√°ssicos... √© sempre algo que mete algum respeito, mesmo que j√° tenhamos lido o que √© considerado a obra maior do seu autor. Mas mergulhar num novo t√≠tulo, para n√≥s, √© sempre algo que merece pelo menos alguma reflex√£o, afinal vamos dar um salto no tempo, ver como as coisas eram h√° uns s√©culos atr√°s... Nesta obra de 1831 at√© acabamos por ir mais longe e visitamos a Paris de 1482, que hoje √© praticamente irreconhec√≠vel, no entanto, o autor leva-nos pela m√£o numa visita guiada e mostra-nos aquela cidade, com os seus impressionantes edif√≠cios como Notre Dame. A sua descri√ß√£o √© bel√≠ssima e alguns dos seus coment√°rios chegam a ser engra√ßados. Perante tudo isto, tive apenas alguma pena por n√£o ter lido o livro assim que voltei de visitar aquela cidade. Era o meu plano em 2011, mas outros livros meteram-se no caminho. Claro que, como disse, a cidade retratada seria irreconhec√≠vel mas de certa forma talvez fosse mais f√°cil situar onde se passa alguma da ac√ß√£o, embora a descri√ß√£o seja o suficiente para, se n√£o trazer √† mem√≥ria a cidade visitada, pelo menos ter a sensa√ß√£o de que se passeia por aquela que ficou perdida no tempo. A hist√≥ria desenrola-se lentamente mas assim que ganha ritmo temos a no√ß√£o de que o fado e o destino se tornam inescap√°veis. N√£o h√° como evitar o que se vai suceder e simplesmente n√£o d√° para desviar o olhar ou a aten√ß√£o da p√°gina que viramos com a esperan√ßa de que n√£o acabe como tememos. As personagens, como a cidade e a hist√≥ria, tamb√©m cativam. √â interessante ver como cada uma ama de forma completamente diferente de outra e como o amor consome cada um. Gudule ama o que h√° muito perdeu; Esmeralda enamora-se por algu√©m bonito mas sup√©rfluo; Febo usa a confus√£o que existe entre amor e desejo em seu proveito; Frollo ama de forma doentia; Quasimodo simplesmente ama. De certa forma traz a lume o mesmo tema que O Fantasma da √ìpera e, como aquele, f√°-lo de forma excelente. Tamb√©m o seu final acaba por ser algo semelhante, de partir o cora√ß√£o e digno para a hist√≥ria. Parece que Paris tem bastantes personagens desfiguradas, e n√£o s√≥ em termos de beleza exterior, a assombrar edif√≠cios e perdidamente apaixonados por raparigas bonitas, ainda que n√£o correspondidos. Por mim, n√£o me importa que assim seja se continuarem a suscitar livros como estes...
96`5`How can I give anything less than 5 stars to Victor Hugo? I'm not sure why I did not read this earlier in my life, but perhaps I was emotionally exhausted by 'Les Miserables' which I studied for A-level French many years ago, and many years later, cried copiously at the stage show, both times I saw it. I'm very glad I found this on audio on the library shelf and took the opportunity to broaden my experience of this celebrated French author. This time I did not cry, but was very much affected by the tragedy of Esmeralda and Quasimodo. I have visited Notre Dame de Paris and even had my photo taken next to a gargoyle and those memories were awakened as I worked my way through the book. I like to compare Hugo to Dickens as they both wrote about the injustices in the system in their respective countries. I this book, Hugo lays bare the hypocrisy of the priesthood, and the difficulties faced by people who are 'different'. Things are not so different now so the story resonates with the reader even centuries after the story was set.
97`3`Hugo is long winded and I'm thinking I would love abridged versions of his novels. It takes plenty of skim reading to find the story within his writing. The stories are marvelous -- the plight of those trodden upon. But getting to the story can be a chore sometimes.
98`4`Hugo was a master. It's is difficult to find genius like this anymore.
99`4`Hugo writes such great characters. This one is far more a tragedy than Les Mis, but still wonderfully complex. Yes, he has a penchant for over-description and tangential dialogue, but I prefer to blame that on the style of the time.
100`5`Hugo, you may be exhausting, but you are brilliant, and this was yet another heart-wrenching but beautiful story. The last three books I've read have been very interesting in the fact that they relayed the history of the world, from seeing the beginning of life to how ancient people came to believe what they believed to how destroying a piece of architecture was actually an attack on thought and ideology. It was very unexpected, but it's been a brilliant reading week.
101`5`I AM AN EMOTIONAL WRECK AT THE MOMENT AND I HOPE TO DIE SOON
102`null`I LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!! Beautiful story, I recommend that everyone reads it!
103`5`I WOULD DIE FOR YOU VICTOR HUGO
104`4`I always thought, that this book had a happy ending. But I think it is difficult to say Hugo and Happy Ending in a sentence. It was my first Hugo (i tried Les Miserables once but it didn't work, probably I was too little and too unripe for it). A fantastic storyteller. The story is good, although there are some long chapters which you can easily pass, it will not affect the reading and the storyline - the one with the description of the Paris from the roofs of Notre Dame, or the one with Ludovic XI and his financial dialogues. However, the one about architecture, its meaning and its sundown in the light of the newly discovered As I said, the story is good, but I wanted more alchemy, more wizardry, more Claude Frollo. He was my favorite character. With Quasimodo and Esmeralda the least. Poor Esmeralda, the singer with a nice body, her lines are so stupid. And everything else in the book is just manly pursuit of that body. The only great character in this book is Claude. Was Hugo a misogynist? Still the book, the atmosphere, the great storytelling - it was good entertainment.
105`5`I am actually surprised I liked this book. I once tried to read "Les Miserables". That didn't work out. But this? I liked. Minus the history parts or heavy passages of architecture. I really liked, of course, the subtle sarcasm. A five star in my book.
106`2`I appreciate what this novel has accomplished, it‚Äôs truly an impressive feat. But it was a massive slog to get through, it put me to sleep and gave me headaches on multiple occasions. It‚Äôs less of a story and more of a study on gothic architecture. I love gothic architecture as much as the next guy, but 600 pages of repetitive, long-winded descriptions of it? I can only handle so much before I want to rip my eyes out. I enjoyed the bits of plot here and there, the elements of tragic irony especially. But it was hard to fully appreciate these moments as I was frustrated and exhausted with reading through the dry descriptions by the time I finally got to them. I‚Äôm glad I read the book, but I can‚Äôt say I got much enjoyment from it. I had similar feelings about The Mysteries of Udolpho.
107`5`I began this novel expecting the story to vaguely resemble the Disney film. Although I anticipated some changes (a 19th century novel could never be so simple), nothing could have prepared me for this novel. A fully fleshed out fairy tale, The Hunchback of NotreDame is dark, heart wrenching, mysterious, suspenseful and filled with heartbreak. The passion behind each character defines them, whether it be Esmeralda's irrational unrequited love for Phoebus or Don Frollo's perverted obsession with the gypsy girl. Between midnight meetings, lost identities, superstitious legends and a hideous hunchback, I truly felt like I was immersed in the world of Brother's Grimm.I think the greatest triumph of this novel were the characters themselves. Hugo dedicates chapters to each character, ensuring the reader fully understands each one's loves, hatreds, virtues and failings. Don Frollo is introduced as brilliant beyond his time - no one can compare to his great mind. The reader then sees the demise of Don Frollo as his obsession with Esmeralda grows, and therefore cannot see him as a one dimensional evil character. This lack of a true enemy is a brilliant move on Hugo's part, and leaves the reader to form opinion's of their own. Throughout the book, Hugo takes breaks from his complicated story to insert his own essays of his own musings. These essays, often adding 50 pages to the already enormous novel, I found tedious and unnecessary. When reading, be wary: they appear more often than anyone would like. All that being said, The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a truly beautiful story, and very much worth reading. As fanciful as Hugo makes 15th century Paris, this story has something timeless and resounding in it, earning its place as a classic. 
108`5`I can see why Hugo influenced Dostoevsky! Hugo is the king of stories!! My translation is Walter J. Cobb, highly recommend his translation. Check out these gems:"surface of that human sea""Time is the architect, the nation is the builder.""A philosopher's house of cards>"My shiny new review: http://www.biblioatlas.com/2017/05/th...
109`null`I cannot rate this book because I didn't get through even more than 5% of it. I can see the humor and that he's poking fun at the upper classes and, I can see and appreciate how he makes fun of the Arrogant students, but I just can't finish this as it's not my style.
110`3`I cheated and listened to the 2 CD audio version by Naxos. It was OK but I was ready for it to end since my mind kept wandering. I don't think I could make it through the whole thing.
111`3`I chose to read this book as part of My Reading Challenge since I definitely need to read more classics, and also because French history is interesting. I also love the Disney adaptation and wanted to see how closely it resembles the original source material.This story is dark, really dark. There's betrayal, heartbreak, deceit, attempted rape, death, and a poor little lad named Quasimodo who is hated by all for his ugliness. I really liked the plot of the book, but the slow pace tragically lowered my overall rating. Many chapters were dedicated to the description of the city and of minor characters, which contributed very little. However, in the right places, Victor Hugo's description was divine and intensified the rest of the story. While I love the Disney film, it would be interesting to see a modern film adaptation that highlights the darker elements of the novel.
112`4`I did enjoy this book although at times it was very heavy going.
113`5`I don't know how this is possible, but sometimes I forget that this is my favorite book in the whole world. Tragic (and wonderfully so) and hilarious and insightful (frighteningly so). The characters are so memorable and conflicted, it's wonderful. I can't decide if I would rather be with Quasimodo in the tower when he rings the bell or by the gargoyles looking over the city. Best book ever written in any language anywhere at any time.
114`4`I don‚Äôt know about you, but I think about obsessional crimes and stalking as modern phenomena, exacerbated by life in huge cities. The Hunchback of Notre-Dame demonstrates that there is truly nothing new under the sun. Victor Hugo wrote this tale of obsession in the 1800s. The gypsy girl, La Esmeralda, has the misfortune of attracting the obsessional gaze of two men, the archdeacon Claude Frollo and his prot√©g√©, the deformed bell-ringer of the cathedral, Quasimodo. She, in her turn, is fixated on handsome Captain Phoebus, who couldn‚Äôt care less about her although he is willing to take advantage of her when an opportunity presents itself.None of these people actually know one another‚Äîthey have only observed from afar and projected their own fantasies onto other people. Quasimodo has the most reason for his adoration of La Esmeralda‚Äîshe brought him water while he was incapacitated at the pillory during an undeserved punishment. Earlier, we see La Esmeralda save Pierre Gringoire, the unsuccessful playwright, from hanging by accepting him as a temporary husband. Pierre is somewhat disappointed when he discovers that she intends a platonic relationship, but is sensible enough to appreciate that her kindness has spared his life. La Esmeralda is presented as a kind, good person. But like many women, she finds herself the focus of unwanted male attention. We often think of stalking in relation to celebrity, but in reality many ordinary citizens find themselves the object of obsession of other ‚Äúregular‚Äù people. A waitress may, by serving a cup of coffee, unwittingly launch an obsessive on a mission to ‚Äúown‚Äù her. Having had a small brush with such behaviour myself, I have realized how startlingly easy it is to become involved in such situations. There are so many lonely people living in our cities, who are used to being ignored while resenting it. If your job requires you to be polite and helpful, these folks may misinterpret your intentions. The crumbs of attention that they receive from you may trigger that hunger for more, beginning something that you never meant to start and which you feel powerless to stop.At the same time, La Esmeralda is guilty of a similar behaviour‚Äîshe knows nothing about Phoebus except that he is handsome and wears a beautiful uniform. She is very young and it is like a young woman today becoming enamoured of a celebrity. Unlike many, La Esmeralda has the opportunity to meet her crush and is only prevented from consummating her desires by her stalker, Archdeacon Frollo.  None of this can end well. Modern instances of stalking are liable to end in death, either of the pursuer or the pursued. The HoND deals with these apparently timeless topics‚ÄîI‚Äôm reminded of Shakespeare‚Äôs tragedies, especially Othello. Victor Hugo‚Äôs tale definitely deserves its reputation as classic literature.
115`3`I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been so stuck on where to rate a book. I found the first half incredibly hard going in fact I think it took me 3 months to get through it as it just didn‚Äôt capture my attention. However the second half was a complete turn around and I was pulled straight into the progressing story so it was well worth persevering with. I settled on 3 stars because although the second half was an action packed and captivating story the first nearly had me give up on it.
116`3`I found this book on the shelf and remembered that I never bothered to read it because of its scary cover. As an adapted version, it's not bad, but it's also missing themes and emotions. It is, however, suitable for a younger audience.
117`5`I had read the abridged version of this book many times but first time I ventured to read the unabridged one. It took me a little while to actually get into the book even though I already knew the story and I'm glad I persisted. I already loved the book but the unabridged version made me love it even more. The writing so so rich and compelling, you can't help feel sorry for even the villain - the Archdeacon. I am half tempted to learn French so that I can the original work as well.
118`5`I had tears streaming down my face at the end of this book! Thanks a lot, Victor Hugo!After getting past the first 100 or so pages, the story really took off. You just have to endure the typical Hugo story set-up, with pages after pages of history including all sorts of French geographical names that trip me up even with just mentally trying to pronounce them. I knew the spoiler about the recluse right away, so that wasn't too much of a mystery. But Claude Frollo's metamorphosis was pretty shocking and creepy. Esmeralda, meh...I'm not going to lie, she kind of annoyed the crap out of me. Gringoire was funny. At least he saved someone!Quotes I enjoyed:"'Do you know what friendship is?' he asked.'Yes,' answered the gypsy, 'it is to be like brother and sister - two souls meeting without mingling - two fingers on the same hand.''And love?' proceeded Gringoire.'Oh! love!' said she - and her voice trembled and her eye beamed 'that is to be two and yet but one - a man and woman blended into an angel - it is heaven!'""Upon the face of this ancient queen of French cathedrals, beside each wrinkle we constantly find a scar. Tempus edax, homo edacior (Time is destructive, man more destructive) - which we would willingly render thus - Time is blind, but man is stupid.""So much so that, to those wo know that Quasimodo once existed, Notre-Dame is now deserted, inanimate, dead. They feel that something has disappeared. That vast body is empty - it is a skeleton - the spirit has quitted it - they see its place and that is all. It is like a skull, which still has holes for the eyes, but no longer sight.""When one does evil, one should do it thoroughly. 'Tis madness to stop midway in the monstrous!""'What have you, then, which attaches you so strongly to life?''Ah! a thousand reasons.''What are they, pray?''What are they? the air, the sky, the morning, the evening, the moonlight, my good friends the Truands, our jeers with the old hags, the fine architecture of Paris to study, three great books to write, one of them against the bishop and his mills; more than I can tell. Anaxagoras used to say he had come into the world to admire the sun. And then I have the felicity of passing the whole of my days, from morning till night, with a man of genius - who is myself - which is very agreeable.'"
119`3`I had this book on my shelf for more than thirty years, intending to read it some day, and never got around to it until one day in early April when my eye lit on it and it just suddenly seemed like it was time. And then about a week after I started it, the cathedral burned. So obviously, like the butterfly wing in chaos theory, my taking it down off the shelf caused the fire...Or maybe it was just a coincidence. Star ratings are of course irrelevant to classics like this; my three stars are an attempt to express that it was a great reading experience but had its irritating aspects. To start with, this has to be the most shamelessly padded book in literary history. Moby Dick with all that stuff about whaling is a model of concise storytelling compared to this massive data dump. Writers are warned about the temptation to jam all their research into a book; Victor Hugo obviously never got that memo. What story there is in this novel proceeds by fits and starts, grinding to a halt every few pages for one of Hugo's interminable disquisitions on history, architecture, philology, alchemy and other arcana. He simply cannot resist showing off. The most trivial event can serve as a pretext for an irrelevant aside, along the lines of "The first of March had arrived. The sun, which Dubartas, that classic ancestor of periphrase, had not yet dubbed the "Grand-duke of Candles," was none the less radiant and joyous on that account." The story, when it can be discerned in this morass of erudition, is familiar to us from movie adaptations or Classic Comics: the hideously deformed Quasimodo, the bell-ringer of Notre Dame cathedral, is slavishly devoted to the hideously repressed archdeacon Claude Frollo, who rescued him as an abandoned infant. The beautiful and innocent Gypsy girl Esmeralda takes pity on Quasimodo when he is being unjustly flogged and gives him water; now Quasimodo and Frollo are rivals for her affection, Quasimodo with a pure and simple devotion and the severely celibate Frollo with a highly impure obsession. For her part Esmeralda is in love with the handsome and empty-headed Phoebus, a soldier. When Esmeralda is accused of witchcraft she takes refuge in the cathedral, where Quasimodo has to protect her from the mob outside and the twisted priest within... It doesn't end well.In fact, the book is pretty much a downer all around. The harsh cruelty of medieval society is sharply depicted, with all its superstition, hysteria, obscurantism and injustice. The denouement (spoiler alert) involves an eye-rolling coincidence which Hugo uses to raise our hopes of a happy ending, only to let us down with a crash. Thanks, Vic. I think I'll just go shoot myself.So why read it? Well, it's fun sometimes to lose yourself for a few weeks in a big massive classic like this; take it a few pages at a time and enjoy the language, enjoy the erudition if you're a history or architecture buff. Stripped of its pretentious irrelevancies, the story is an endorsement of the Enlightenment and a protest against medieval repression and superstition. Hugo could have used an editor, but if you're willing to take your time and wade through his meandering observations, you will find things to like. Otherwise, stick to the Charles Laughton flick or the Disney animated feature.
120`5`I have officially been wooed by nineteenth century French literature. First Dumas and now this. I just finished reading Victor Hugo‚Äôs The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, and it was fantastic. The characters, the themes, the literary structures‚Ä¶ Ahhh‚Ä¶ *swoons*Before I proclaim my love affair with Victor Hugo, I have to mention some negatives. First off: very, very difficult book to get into. I struggled through at least the first hundred pages, and I‚Äôm not that hard to please. Secondly, up until this point, I had always thought that abridged novels were ridiculous. How could the editors take parts out and still have the story make sense? Upon reading unabridged Hugo, I understand. The man had complete chapters devoted to discussing the history of Paris or the history of the cathedral, and while I admit that it was a clever way to show off his knowledge and spread his political ideals, it was not what I bargained for.The novel would have been more accurately titled ‚ÄúThe Archdeacon of Notre Dame.‚Äù (Frollo was not a judge as in the Disney movie. They just tried to secularize him to an equivalent position.) I argue that Frollo was the protagonist. The story spent most of its time with him: his internal struggle, his plotting. And his character was fantastic! He was underhanded, but I pitied him. He was pathetic, but I feared him. He did evil, but I loved him. Frollo was not simply a powerful villain; he was a dynamic, complex character that, at times, the reader could really sympathize with.The other characters in the novel were equally impressive. Esmeralda‚Äôs sweet, strong innocence (she was only sixteen) and foolish devotion to Phoebus is heart wrenching. Quasimodo‚Äôs strength of body and heart is awe-inspiring. Phoebus‚Äô selfish arrogance is antagonizing. The minor characters, from the old heckling woman, to the foolish young Frollo (the Archdeacon‚Äôs brother), to the rambling philosopher, create a motley portrait of a fascinating world.Hugo‚Äôs occasional comments on society cannot go unnoted. I especially enjoyed one episode where Quasimodo was being questioned in court. In the novel, unlike in the Disney movie, Quasimodo is deaf, so, as he is being questioned, he tries to anticipate the judge‚Äôs questions and answer them accordingly. The irony is that the judge was doing the same thing. Hugo created a deaf judge. Beautiful. Anyway, a funny scene ensued, and Hugo made his point.The best part of the story (maybe, there were just so many good ones) was likely Hugo‚Äôs portrayal of love. Love was everywhere: the inexplicable love Frollo had for his useless brother, the love that caused Frollo to accept Quasimodo, the love that broke a mother‚Äôs heart at the loss of her daughter, the faithful love that sent Quasimodo to Frollo with his tail between his legs‚Ä¶ But the most stunning and provocative of all was the comparison of the three men who ‚Äúloved‚Äù Esmeralda: one man, ‚Äúloving‚Äù her so much that he wanted to possess her; one man, ‚Äúloving‚Äù her for the moment, until another girl came along; and one man ‚Äúloving‚Äù her so much that she went before everything: before his desire to be with her, before his desire to have her, before his own desire to live. *swoons again* Awesome book‚Ä¶When I started reading it, everyone felt the need to warn me that it didn‚Äôt end like the Disney movie. I was afraid. I was scared that after stringing me along, Hugo was going to kill it at the end. Don‚Äôt worry: he doesn‚Äôt. The end is moving and beautiful and fitting and so what if it‚Äôs not Disney: it‚Äôs great.And, to further please the happy reader, there were a million good quotes. Here you go:‚ÄúOh, love!... That is to be two, and yet one. A man and a woman joined, as into an ange; that is heaven!‚Äù (Esmeralda).‚ÄúGreat edifices, like great mountains, are the work of the ages.‚Äù‚ÄúHe found that man needs affection, that life without a warming love is but a dry wheel, creaking and grating as it turns.‚Äù‚ÄúAlas! The small thing shall bring down the great things; a tooth triumphs over a whole carcass. The rat of the Nile destroys the crocodile, the swordfish kills the whale; the book will kill the edifice‚Äù (Frollo).‚ÄúIt is to this setting sun that we look for a new dawn.‚Äù‚ÄúSpira, spera.‚Äù (‚ÄúBreathe, hope.‚Äù)‚ÄúFor love is like a tree; it grows of itself; it send its roots deep into our being, and often continues to grow green over a heart in ruins.‚Äù‚ÄúWhat man orders‚Ä¶ Circumstances disorder‚Äù (Frollo).‚ÄúEveryone knows that great wealth is not acquired by letters, and that the most accomplished writers have not always a warm hearth in wintertime. The lawyers take all the wheat for themselves and leave nothing by chaff for the other learned professions‚Äù (Gringoire, the philosopher). ‚ÄúA lighted candle never attracts one gnat only.‚Äù‚ÄúThat‚Äôs life‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs often our best friends who make us fall‚Äù (Gringoire).‚ÄúThe human voice is music to the human ear.‚ÄùJust a wonderful sample of the jewels contained in The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. The novel was difficult, but well worth the effort. I‚Äôm just sitting here in awe of it. I can‚Äôt write any more.
121`4`I haven't read that many Graphic Novels but I really enjoyed this one. It was short and it was a story that I kind of knew, I have only ever seen the Disney movie and that had a happier ending. While I did enjoy the story I wish that I had read the actual novel before reading/looking at the graphic novel. I will hopefully be reading the actual story someday and come to love it.
122`5`I know it is not the original, but sometimes adapted books are just as joyable reading as originals amd it is a short read :)
123`3`I like this, but I'm not finding anything much storywise that wasn't in the Classics Illustrated version I obsessively read and reread as a child. Hugo's occasional diversions into Paris and discussions of the significance of architecture and printing are fine, but not keeping me going right now. Easy-to-read translation.
124`2`I liked Les Miserables more.Like Les Mis, I listened to eAudio read by the fabulous David Case.Esmeralda was just TSTL.
125`4`I liked it-- it does drag in some places and keep interest very well in others. Having been to Paris and Notre-Dame does greatly help keep one's personal interest for even the architectural and setting pieces, though. And yes, the characters are pretty much a mess, but that's Hugo's tragic style.
126`3`I listened a great audiobook version of this read by Bill Homewood and published by Naxos.I think the excellent narration was responsible for more that 75% of my enjoyment. In this story, Hugo writes a love letter to Paris, adds some wry humor and sarcastic quips about Church, State and Society and has great fun with language. If you are expecting the Disney romance you will be disappointed.The story starts with a large cast of characters who span the social strata of Parisian society and a chaotic National Holiday. There are multiple story lines, characters wend their way across Paris crossing paths and then moving on. It is a very confusing first day. Happily, Bill Homewood gives each main character their own voice, diction and manner so I had no trouble keeping them straight. Usually, I like to track details in a story, but I had to give that up and just go for the gist.The City of Paris is an important character in this story, and there is a long section describing it in detail. Bill Homewood's narration led me to feel that I was walking the streets with him. The beauty of the French language, and Hugo's love for it, comes through when Homewood reads the names of people, streets and districts. To breeze over the sounds of those words would be to miss part of Hugo's artistry.Finally this is a social commentary and Homewood's intonation is perfect for conveying that. His reading is straight forward which allows the Hugo's wit to shine through.Finally, if it had not been for Homewood's skill, I probably would not have finished the book but I am very glad I did. Now I just have to get to Paris!I started with a different audio book, from Blackstone, that was abysmal.
127`3`I listened to the audiobook and while it is a fantastic story, I found my mind wandering. Just too wordy to listen to on audiotape if you have an attention span like mine. Some beautiful descriptions of Medieval Paris, which went on and on. Definitely worth reading, there is a lot good here.
128`3`I listened to this on a French language audiobook, downloaded at no cost from http://www.litteratureaudio.com/. The English title is The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. It was the first time I have tackled this classic of French literature. I suspect that I appreciate the fact that I made the effort more than I appreciate the work itself. I chose to listen on audiobook so that I would not feel compelled to look up every single word I wasn't sure of in the dictionary. This strategy worked for me. I understood the narrative without too much difficulty, although I did occasionally check in with a written version to ensure that I didn't miss anything. The book is not an easy read. There are bits of it I love: the descriptions of Paris and of Notre-Dame Cathedral are breathtaking, as are other passages describing, for example, the night sky. I also liked the narrative voice, which Hugo uses to create the illusion that he is recounting history and not writing fiction. This is a clever, if at times intrusive, device, which allows the writer to discourse on subjects of interest to him - notably his views about the decline of great architecture as a form of communication. However, notwithstanding its strengths, I rarely felt completely engaged or totally absorbed. I think that this is because the characters are rarely more than symbols and sometimes not much more than cariactures. In my view, the novel is too much driven by ideas and not enough driven by character. At the end of the day, I wasn't as moved by the fate of the protagonists as I might have been if Hugo had invested a little more time in making them living, breathing people. That said, I found the last part of the book enthralling and I couldn't stop listening until it was finished. It was at the end that I cared most about the main characters. Overall, I'm glad I made the effort, but I doubt that I will re-read this novel any time soon. 
129`3`I love the message of the story
130`5`I love this tragedy
131`5`I love tragedy. Poor Quasimodo. Poor Esmeralda
132`5`I loved it. It is very different from the Disney movie, and everyone is an asshole except Quasimodo and Esmeralda, but it is simply beautiful. I confess I wept some tears at the end.
133`4`I loved this book in College. Dark and gothic. Talk about alienation, this book got that right and one of the most memorable characters. The ultimate alienation story.
134`5`I need some more time to process this book, it's all very epic, very grand.The only background I have of this is the Disney film, and as you can imagine there are huge differences.The first is that while Quasimodo the hunchback is in the book, he is more of a supporting character and a catalyst for the action.The story is set in medieval Paris. It is the story of three men and their relationship to a beautiful (on the outside and the inside) Esmeralda. There is Frollo, a priest that lusts after her and is driven into jealousy and rage. There is Phoebus, a young captain that Esmeralda loves but is only using her, and Quasimodo who only wants to protect her. Because of his deformities he does not even wish for her but only wants to see her safe.The story gets going after Frollo attempts to murder Phoebus out of jealousy. Esmeralda is tried and convicted of the crime and sentenced to be executed. Quasimodo saves her and claims sanctuary in Notre Dame.The story also has a lot of asides and themes about justice and injustice with Esmeralda and Quasimodo serving as symbolism for society's outcasts. Also about the corrupt church and it's oppression of the people.My only disappointment is the same as many others on here: it's too long! Victor Hugo spends long passages describing the history and setting of Paris. (I skimmed these.)  
135`3`I quite enjoyed Victor Hugo's writing style. In this narrative, his voice is that of a gossip with a secret that they can't wait to tell you. It might be a naughty secret. So that part of it was fun. SPOILER ALERT: I was annoyed by some of the main characters because everyone who fell 'in love' with Esmeralda did so because she was pretty. It was pretty lame, because Esmeralda had all the smarts and instincts of a gopher trying to take the SATs. And she was irritating as hell because she fell 'in love' with the womanizing boozer moron Phoebus (or his uniform anyway), who cares about her boobs more than her life. I was disappointed, but Phoebus was the most honest character in the book. He at least was like "Marriage? Are you kidding? I just wanted some!"Ii realize that this was set in late 1400's in France and she was about 15 or 16 with no formal education, but you'd think that a gypsy would be at least clever enough to preserve herself from idiots and at least be able to figure out love rather than thinking that the guy was hot in his uniform. Quasimodo was just sad, and the priest was just horny enough to go insane but without Phoebus' courage to at least admit it. My favorite characters were the poet/philosopher and the priest's younger brother. They were drunks and goofballs who provided some comic relief. 
136`3`I rather enjoyed this book, but I do have one fault with it.WAY TOO BORING.The plot itself is one about acceptance and enduring love, but it gets really long winded at points. If you only took the first few chapters, one in the middle, and the end, you'd get a brilliant, poignant novel.The makings of a brilliant book is most certainly present, but it is WAY TOO LONG to keep someone hooked
137`1`I read the unabridged version of this, and now I know why there is an abridged version. It took me months too get through it all! Overall, the book was okay. I foolishly assumed it was clean since it was written in 1831. I almost didn't finish it. Heartrending story though. Just filled with a lot of filth. Blah. Brilliant writing, yucky story. Definitely won't read again.
138`4`I read this as the first of a 10-book adventure into literature set in Paris. For that project, I could not have selected a more perfect beginning. One of the chapters is an aerial view of Paris - aerial being the view of Paris from the towers of Notre Dame. I quite enjoyed the story. Unfortunately, I felt the characterizations were more caricatures, except that of Quasimodo. Hugo did a brilliant job of evoking an emotional response from me in this one character because I thought he was the only one with true emotion. The other reason I can't give this 5 stars is that this period in history doesn't especially appeal to me. It is quite readable and I'm very glad to have read it. One day, I'll look forward to picking up his Les Mis√©rables.
139`5`I really love the story presented in this book, and I think it was written extraordinarily well. However, my only problem with it is that I feel that there was a lot of unnecessary filler (though I can't rate it lower than a 5).Seriously, the chapter "A Bird's Eye View of Paris" and the chapter about Louis's prayers (which are some of the longest chapters) could have been cut out of this book entirely without anything affecting the actual plot.I understand that this was written in the nineteenth century, and everyone back then ate that stuff up, but it's a bunch of descriptions and not much else. With that said, I enjoy Victor Hugo's writing a lot, and I will definitely check out more of his work.
140`3`I really understand why this book still appeals so much, if only for its historical value. But I have to be honest: this is a very unlikely story with lots of strange issues, especially in the plot. Victor Hugo clearly wrote this in a hurry. But this said and done: it nevertheless captivates. I think this is because of the compelling atmosphere he succeeded in evocating and because of the protagonists with their strong traits: Frosso as a kind of Faust, the endearing, human monster Quasimodo and the intriguing Esmeralda (though she remains a bit caricatural). Though it has its downsides, this still is a great read.
141`2`I really wanted to like this book. However between the chapters that discussed at length the layout of Paris and politics of the time and the way it ended I really didn‚Äôt enjoy it at all.
142`1`I really wanted to like this book. I really wanted to finish this book. But when the author goes on and on about Paris architecture FOR 100 PAGES I just can't keep going. The second half of this book must be the most magnificent piece of literature ever written for this book to be as famous as it is. But I'm sorry, if the first half bores me to death then I'm not going to keep reading it. Maybe I should be ashamed since I'm a French teacher and all, and I really tried, but I just couldn't do it. Sorry Monsieur Hugo. I am obviously not a good enough literary scholar to appreciate your work.
143`3`I really wanted to like this book.I'd heard a lot of great things about this book prior to reading and have a big spot in my heart for 18th and 19th century novels. So I came to this book with a good manner of anticipation.When all was said and done, though... I came away ambivalent about the story. To be sure, there are some good moments--the villain is quite good, there are some great unexpected plot twists, and I love Hugo's side-ruminations on architecture and how it shapes people. But it was also a slog to get through at points. I'm accustomed to stories that take a long time to get started (hello, Brothers Karamazov) because there's the implicit promise that it will all be worth it by the end of the story.In this case, though? I felt like many aspects of the story (including the first 100 pages) really spent a lot of time establishing things that really didn't impact the main story as a whole in this estimation. And while the ending was fine, it was just that--it was fine and after going through 180,000 some words, I was looking for something more than fine.The best parts of the story were Hugo's reflections on the purpose of architecture, and I'm quite glad I read through those sections (and will likely come back to them again). As for the rest of the story... I'm glad to have finally read this classic, but am really not a huge fan of the actual work.Rating: 2.5-3 Stars (Okay).
144`5`I recently read Victor Hugo's Notre Dame de Paris for the first time, and was delighted and moved by the experience. Although it lacks the depth and humanity of Les Miserables, it possesses a grandeur of architectonic structure and an Olympian compassion all its own. Best of all, it gives us one of literature's most loving and detailed depictions of a city, rivaled only by Joyce's Dublin in Ulysses.It is a shame that this book is so seldom referred to in English by its given name, for it is about more than the history of one hunchback, however moving that history may be. First of all, it is about the great cathedral that dominates and defines the city, the setting for much of the novel's action and most of its crucial events. It is also about the ‚Äúgenius loci‚Äù of Paris, the maternal spirit that offers sanctuary and support to its most unfortunate children, many of them literally orphans (Gringoire, Quasimodo, Esmeralda, the Frollos), be they ugly or beautiful, virtuous or evil, bringing a measure of comfort to their difficult and and often tragic lives. Hugo's novel had been on my lengthy ‚Äúmust read‚Äù list for years, but what finally moved it to the top was my growing fascination with cities in literature. In childhood, my favorite Arabian Night's tales were the ones that took place in Baghdad, and from early adolescence I loved Sherlock Holmes' London, D'Artagnan's Paris and Nero Wolfe's New York. I also began to appreciate more fantastic cities, such as Stevenson and Machen's London and Leiber's Lankhmar. Soon I fell in love with the hard boiled detective genre and‚Äîhaving been a childhood fan of Arthurian romances‚Äîidentified with each of these modern knight-errants on a quest. I also realized that the individuality of each city‚Äîand the private detective's familiarity with it and his relation to it--was an essential part of the genre's charm. Even the most realistic of private eye cities‚ÄîRobert B. Parker's Boston, for example‚Äîwere filled with as many marvels as any Arthurian Romance: instead of a sorceress, one might meet a sexy widow; instead of a liveried dwarf, a mysterious butler; and instead of a disguised knight offering a cryptic challenge one might be offered a tailing job by a Beacon Hill Brahmin with a mask of smiles and hidden motivations. The world of the marvelous had been transported from the isolated castles, woods and meadows of England's ‚Äúgreen and pleasant land‚Äù to the magnificent townhouses and seedy alleys of an urban environment. How had this occurred, and what were the literary antecedents?I believe that Notre Dame de Paris in 1831 is the point where this all begins. Hugo took a shoot of the delicate gothic already in decline, grafted it to the hearty root of the city (or--more precisely--to a Gothic cathedral in the center of a great city, where it was most likely to flourish), watered it from the oasis of Arabian marvels (dangerous hunchback, guild of thieves, beautiful dancing girl), and cultivated the resulting growth with the historical method of Sir Walter Scott. Thus the urban romance was born.This was just the start, of course. Another decade of industrialism and population growth would make the great European cities seem even more like ancient Baghdad. Dickens would make the thieves guild central to the sinister London of Oliver Twist and Eugene Sue's exploration of urban vices in The Mysteries of Paris (1841) would soon be successfully imitated--commercially if not artistically‚Äîby England's Reynolds in The Mysteries of London and America's Lippard in The Quaker City, or The Monks of Monk's Hall.A little later the detective arrived in the gothic city (Poe's DuPont, Gaboriau's Lecoq, Conan Doyle's Holmes) and soon the marvelous and fantastic were re-introduced (Stevenson's New Arabian Nights, Machen's The Three Imposters) as well, fully preparing the urban landscape for the writers of the 20th century to construct their cities of romance in the worlds of detection and fantasy.Hugo tells us that the bones of Quasimodo and Esmeralda have long ago turned to dust, but the marvelous city of crimes and dreams continues to live on.
145`5`I suffered through Victor Hugo's Les Miserables in high school French, but I thought I'd take this on the airplane on my way to Paris, and I wasn't disappointed at all. The plot begins by following a somewhat minor character (who keeps popping up at crucial points and becomes something more major to the plot and theme), a poet who writes a morality play, fails utterly to perform it and get paid for it, and falls in with a crowd to thieves and vagabonds. On his descent, he encounters the innocent and beautiful Esmeralda (with her pet goat, who is even more enchanting), the pitiful and powerful Quasimodo, the shining knight Phoebus, and the conflicted archdeacon Claude Frollo: all the major characters. His story entwines with theirs as we learn their histories, their desires, and their deepening involvement with each other that can only end in tragedy. I loved how slowly the book built up the plot, revolving through each character and the occasional tangent into say, the history of medieval Paris, or a description of Notre Dame, before really taking off. The pacing is incredible: the first 300 pages are sort of set-up, and then the plot moves as the characters really encounter and react to each other, which is another 300 pages. The characters are completely indivduated, whether it's one of the main ones we see every other chapter, or a minor one, like the poet, or King Louis XI, or Frollo's younger brother, a gambler who steals church money to pay for his free-wheeling ways. The setting of medieval Paris (Hugo delayed writing the novel several times to continue his research) is so well described you might want a map to follow along when he describes a certain area of town that no longer exists (and didn't exist in 1830 when Hugo was writing).In short, a great book, highly recommended for people who like long books and have a certain kind of patience for the way novels were once written.
146`4`I think I would have enjoyed this more if I resided in Paris. Hugo spends whole (long) chapters describing 15th century Paris: the geography, characteristics of the various neighborhoods and the view from Notre Dame Cathedral. I‚Äôm sure Paris has changed a lot since then, but those chapters would still have made more sense to someone familiar with the city. As it was, they were fairly tedious.The story was a good, tragic romance, and enjoyable if you don‚Äôt mind 19th century romantic literature. I‚Äôd like to think everyone reading this is familiar with the plot, but if you watched the Disney version, you have no clue. As I understand, Disney turned the handsome but weak soldier who could have saved Esmeralda (and chose not to)into the hero/leading man, then gave the story a happy ending. Victor Hugo must be turning over in his grave.I enjoyed the book, but I liked ‚ÄúLes Miserables‚Äù better.
147`2`I thought this was a really sad story because at the end everyone that the hunchback ever liked dies.This is a story about a hunchback who lives at the Notre Dame cathedral. He gets punished because people think he is trying to steal a gypsy because he was running after her. The hunchback was deaf from ringing the bells. When he went to court, the gypsy gave him water. Then the priest of Notre Dame tried to take the gypsy as his wife, but she didn't want to, so he put her to trial. The priest almost killed Captain Phebias so the priest could marry the gypsy, but then when she wouldn't have the priest, he blamed the attack on the gypsy, Esmeralda. After the trial, the hunchback tries to save her, but the people from the court of miracles start to attack him. 
148`2`I want to state clearly that the book is not bad. I gave it two stars, and by that I mean it is OK! First of all, there are some really gorgeous lines. Secondly, Hugo has the ability to put you in the middle of an event; you are right there and it is whirling around you. Thirdly, he has a talent for weaving non-fictional facts into a fictional story. Sometimes the writing feels wordy. Other times, Hugo expresses himself superbly, beautifully, elegantly.The fictional elements are what give me the most trouble. Hugo and his writing and particularly this book belong to the French Romantic Movement of literature. It is not merely that romance is a central theme, but rather that the whole style of writing is romantic, sentimental, exaggerated and overwrought. Excess and exaggeration are the defining ingredients of every event that occurs. Personally, I can deal with romance if presented in a realistic, believable manner. That is not what is delivered here! None of the fictional elements of this story can be characterized as down to earth, believable or realistic. At the start, you work on understanding what is going on. The confusion clears, and the reader begins to know who is who and what is happening. The momentum builds. Most is still within bounds. Then, all breaks loose and reality totally dissolves. Some excitement is fine. I was engaged; I thought the events were exciting. Then, with one thing on top of the other, all credibility is lost. This draws for you how it feels to progress through the book.There are long chapters devoid of characters or plot. In these the time frame departs from the Middle Ages, goes centuries back and up to when the book was printed in 1831. Hugo leaves the story and focuses on architecture, its essence, its importance and various styles. He speaks of the history of Paris, that is to say how the city of Paris has developed over centuries. These sections are interesting, but they are weakly tied to the story. Hugo is delivering a message. As a result of the book, in Paris, buildings of the Gothic style came to be restored! This being exactly what the author had attempted to achieve. There is humor, often ironic in tone, criticizing the Church, royalty, aristocracy and class. Pay attention to the lines, there is humor everywhere. Individual characters are poked at and made fun of.This is a book of historical fiction, written by Hugo primarily from September 1830 to February 1831, but it is about events occurring during three months in 1482. The setting is Paris under the reign of King Louis XI. The cathedral itself is a central character. In French, the book was originally entitled Notre-Dame de Paris. The English translation by Frederic Shoberl in 1833 changed the title to The Hunchback of Notre-Dame to attract readers of Gothic fiction popular in Britain at that time. This is a book about head-over-heels, passionate love, love at first sight. Love without bounds. It is about unrequited love. It is also about love, not of the heart, but of convenience. It is about being torn between love of a woman and love of God, faith and religion. There is witchery, murder, attempted rape, hangings and torture. Each occurring several times.I listened to the audiobook narrated by Bill Homewood. I don‚Äôt think he does a bad job. The way he reads captures the feel of the author‚Äôs words. Nevertheless, the evil characters sound the same--mean and gruff and dark. There is the angelic Esmeralda, sounding meek. Contrary to this, the other women are shrill. You can group the characters into types; listening you know to which group each individual belongs. If you are really lazy, you need not even listen to the words, just listen to the tones! I say this as a joke, as a poke. In my view, it is the author who has over-simplified his characters; the narrator is only mirroring what the author has created.I prefer Victor Hugo's Les Mis√©rables. It isn‚Äôt as fanciful as this and has more interesting historical tidbits. Both have lyrical lines, both have exciting episodes, and both enable a reader to experience another time and place in history. I like how Victor Hugo writes, but the story of The Hunchback of Notre-Dame is too unbelievable for me!It is interesting to note that in France the author‚Äôs poetry collections are more popular than his novels.
149`3`I wanted to love this book but I just couldn't. Hugo is an incredible writer- I loved his wording, description of Paris, style, insight. However, I just can't get behind his story. The depravity of almost every character mixed with the most depressing circumstances had me fuming by the end. For the first time ever, I had to read the clift notes because I just couldn't wrap my mind around what I was really reading. I would give Hugo a 4 star for his writing and maybe a 2 star for his storyline.
150`5`I was absolutely awestruck by the genius of Victor Hugo. As a lot of us could guess, this has very few similarities to Disney's adaptation of this classic novel. You have some of the same characters and settings but that is about where it stops. For starters, I would never give this book to a younger audience. It is chalked full of deep symbolism, well-developed characters, and foreshadowing that could leave anyone wondering,  How did I not see that coming?  I will be brutally honest, the first third of the book was incredibly hard to get into. Hugo's descriptions were beautiful, but sometimes it felt like it got in the way of the plot. Still, I would say that after you get yourself emerged in the book. It will be incredibly hard to put down. The story is centered around the cathedral of Notre-Dame and the people associated with it. The book's true main character is the archdeacon Frollo. The reader will easily become torn whether they should love or hate him. Hate him for his wickedness or feel sympathetic for his reasoning of why. Why would him, of all people, feel the things he does. I was drawn towards this book since we are using it as our musical and our competitive play. It is truly eyeopening to see how your character is portrayed and to make connections with not only who you are playing, but who you are everyday. I highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to be sitting here, still wondering after a week of finishing the book,  How on earth could someone be so cruel? 
151`2`I was hoping for another Les Mis, but this was just so tedious. Maybe I wasn‚Äôt in the mood for Hugo‚Äôs overwrought, emotional prose, or his long-winded descriptions, or maybe this really is just a far inferior book.
152`5`I was profoundly moved when I read this book many years back, and am right now so very sad and shocked to witness the tragic sight of Notre Dame on fire. My heart goes out to the French people.
153`3`I was really looking forward to reading this and i feel a little let down. It's not that it was bad but rather disappointing. It really didn't need to be 500 pages, it's quite a simple story but Hugo obviously thought it needed rambling melodramatic monologues no one would really say in real life, tedious descriptions and history lessons that have nothing or add nothing to the story. Parts of this book are just flatout boring. But on the other hand it did have some parts that were really good and some of the scenes were cool when it wasn't overwritten. AND...............did Pierre Gringoire wunna fuck that goat!?! 
154`5`I went into this book knowing exactly how it was going to end, and therefore thought I was prepared. I could not have been more wrong in this assumption. Victor Hugo is one of those authors with a rare talent for knowing exactly how to pluck at your heart strings, and playing them in just the right key, with a consistent and unfaltering rhythm. I'm not ashamed to admit that I didn't even attempt to stop myself from sobbing multiple times. However, the book definitely has its high points as well. I often found myself laughing along with the characters at their joking and oftentimes sardonic conversations. I loved the book, and therefore gave it five stars;with that said, I feel I should add somewhat of a disclaimer. I must admit that I found it a bit slow at the beginning. It was somewhat redundant and meandering at times; there were a few times I struggled to read even one chapter in a single sitting. However, once the plot picks up, it becomes impossible to put down. So if you want to read it, my advice is to not give up at the beginning; keep going, because it's definitely worth it. I found myself constantly comparing the novel to the classic Disney film, and continuously trying to decide whether the film was a worthy adaptation. I was very conflicted; in some ways I was very impressed with the accuracy with which Disney portrayed some of the details and storyline; in others I was upset about the major plot points they chose to omit. All in all, I'm going to say what all avid readers have to say about a novel that has a film adaptation: the book is definitely better.If you're still reading this review, I appreciate your patience; I don't usually write reviews this long, but take it as a testament to how good the book is. I could go on for hours about Victor Hugo's addicting, albeit morbid, story that will break your heart and make you believe in true love all at once, but I'll stop here, and let you read the book and (hopefully) fall in love with it for yourself. 
155`4`I went into this book with no knowledge of the story other than a few character names. I did not expect the plot to be as it turned out.
156`3`I'm glad I read this and can say "I read The Hunchback of Notre-Dame." But it really was a slog to get through. I really wanted to like it, but it was just a very difficult read. Very hard to pick through all the descriptions and other junk to get to the actual story. But I get to mark it off the list!!
157`2`I'm leaving the French version the original Tom one or volume one, not the English but I have read the English very abbreviated version more than 35 years ago. So I'm looking forward to this original.
158`3`I'm now reading Hugo's "The Man Who Laughs" and so far it's a terrific page-turner: I found myself emotionally involved within the first few chapters. But "Hunchback" and Les Miz" had the opposite effect on me as I couldn't get emotionally involved in either of them.
159`5`I'm so glad to have finally read this book. Victor Hugo is supernaturally good at displaying every nook and cranny of humanity's moral spectrum. Rather than give us Disney cartoons, Hugo's story traffics in uncomfortably complex characters whose moments of kindness and of selfishness all play off each other in a crescendo of inevitable tragedy. The beauty in ugliness, the ugliness in beauty and the self-destruction inherent in excessive desire are all here for the reader to wade through and try to make sense of. Hugo's also as talented at fluid, beautiful description as he is at characterization. Usually, I get bored pretty fast of the 19th century habit of exhaustively drawing every facet of a locale. But I could read Hugo describing Paris all day. Far from a maudlin, melodramatic fairytale, this is a book that gets deep into the mud of what it means to be a messy and complicated human being.
160`1`I'm sorry, but I was bored out of my mind by this book. It took me many months to finish it, and I'm surprised I finished it at all. Well, the first reason why this book is bound to disappoint is the mistaken title. In French, the book is called "Notre Dame de Paris" - and that is what the book is about. The cathedral. Hugo devotes pages upon pages to describe the building, and how it changes over the centuries, and what goes on on the market square beneath its mighty towers. It is a social novel without any main character, but rather attempts to paint a portrait of the entire medieval society that bustles around at the foot of the building. The hunchback is only one fragment in a mosaic of many different characters who represent the (Parisian) social strata, something which the writers of the Literary Realism movement were interested in describing - in every last little detail - during the mid 19th century. This was my first book by Victor Hugo, and most likely to be the last. I know he is a towering figure in French literature, whose human rights ideals influenced the politics of his days; he was a revered writer who received a state funeral. But, I can't help it. I was soo bored. Maybe I am just too ignorant to see the greatness of his meandering prose, or maybe I read a bad translation (I doubt that is the reason, though). Perhaps his other books are better. But I am not sure if I want to tackle another book of his. 
161`5`If I was going to do a detailed review, I should have done it a week or so ago when I actually finished it. That said, this is a great novel that has been horribly defaced by the various Hollywood interpretations. Oh, there are some great performances (in particular, the great Charles Laughton's effort), but "Hunchback" (the novel) is not a happy ending story. It has the character leveling tragedy that you might find in a grouchy, realistic Thomas Hardy novel, but done on an epic scale that a Tolstoy might deliver. As others have noted, the actual hunchback, Quasimodo, isn't in this very long novel all that much. But if anything, that just adds to the dramatic effect when he lowers himself from the walls of Notre Dame cathedral to (temporarily) save Esmeralda. Quasimodo aside, there are number of great and colorful characters (many of them horrible human beings) and memorable scenes, as well as a number of thorough lessons in Paris gothic architecture and late French medieval history. I never found these boring. If anything, these sections added greater context and texture to the novel as a whole. I don't know why it is that publishers feel they need to abridge French novels (see, for example, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea) for modern readers. Still, there were some moments toward the end of this novel where I was ready to dock it a star for some of the long-winded speeches, mostly from arch-villain and Archdeacon Claude Frollo, as he panted over Esmeralda. But then Hugo threw some "foaming" kisses into the mix, and I knew then he swinging for the Gothic fences. Highly recommended, but seek out the Modern Library (unabridged) translation by Catherine Liu. I got it cheap ($2.99), via Kindle.
162`5`Impresionante.El √∫ltimo cap√≠tulo que compara la escritura con la arquitectura, su batalla campal por ganar el coraz√≥n y la permanencia del hombre en la historia, es simplemente genial. La historia ven√≠a bien, divertida y oscura de a momentos, con un an√°lisis individual de cada personaje de manera sutil hasta los cap√≠tulos de Quasimodo y Frollo, los que encima parecen culminar la primera parte: Es como si todo hubiera llevado de forma lenta hacia ellos, las dos almas de Notre Dame... Pero ese √∫ltimo cap√≠tulo significa todo en esta obra en la que en todo momento Victor Hugo no pierde el tiempo para despilfarrar quejas contra las refacciones y arquitectura "modernas" (por cierto, cosa muy divertida de leer).Nunca voy a volver a ver de la misma manera un patrimonio de la arquitectura. Es la misma nostalgia con la que se mira un libro viejo en una tienda de segunda mano, el anciano al que nadie se lleva. En el caso de los edificios, el cascar√≥n vac√≠o.
163`3`In a typical Hugo fashion, there were intervening chapters with naught to do with the story. I don't know if I'm exaggerating since I've really only read this and Les Miserables but it feels like it's his style along with overly romanticising everybody and add to that, the swooning fall-in-love trope. Not that I mind the last bit very much except that the lady is lacking in character somewhat. Dear Esmeralda...She fainted here!She fainted there!She fainted everywhere!I expected an intelligent gypsy girl to have more Gumption!On the other hand, I actually felt sorry for the villain, Claude Frollo, **evil laughs**I feel his lack of nurture and therefore, inability / incapability to deal with emotions which no one had ever previously stirred in his heart. He was a nut-job obviously but as all of us are defined by the world around us, so was he.And for the Disney movie lovers... pssst, do NOT ever read this book with the most tragic ending Ever! You have Disney to thank for that ;p
164`2`In love with a prickstalked by an obsessive creepcherished by a goat.
165`5`In order to adequately describe a book like this, you would need the talent of...a Victor Hugo.This is so deep, so interesting, so well written and well thought out, that the only word you can think of when you are done with it is "chef d'oeuvre". Ie, masterpiece. One could sum it up by saying that EVERYTHING IS HERE- Victor Hugo's power of description is outstanding. I have read it in the original French- it took me two months but I "made it". At times I had to struggle with the vast vocabulary the author uses- many words I had never encountered anywhere before, not even in Balzac. Yet I have read it through. I really loved the way Hugo perfectly describes France and Paris in the 15th century- he goes to the point of practically writing an ESSAY on the architecture of Paris monuments and places at that specific period. Yes, I have to confess it becomes boring eventually, but his obvious intention was to offer the reader a complete portrayal of the people and times he was describing in the book. As such, all the descriptions served to give the story more depth. There's much to say about the story and the characters- especially about the sad, truly tragic hero called Quasimodo- one of the most poignant characters I have ever come across- yet NOTHING I can say could do justice to such a fantastic novel. This one DESERVES to be read. Victor Hugo's style is rich and complex. He actually had the talent of a true storyteller, and if he sometimes seems to be taking to long to advance the story, that's just because he wants the reader to have a complete idea of what's happening- and he highly succeeds.No film adaptation (and there have been many) could ever match such an incomparable literary masterpiece like this.
166`5`In the Middle Ages, Paris was a melting pot of the pious and the wicked, the vagrant and the outcast. Set surrounding the famous Notre-Dame de Paris is Victor Hugo's classic story of complex passions, mysterious/mistaken identities, not judging based on appearances and the tragic consequences of a backwards, lawless time and society. All at once, and for very different reasons, the vain, foolish soldier Phoebus, the tormented, lascivious priest Frollo, and the innocent, misshapen bell-ringer Quasimodo fall for the beautiful, naive and searching gypsy Esmeralda. When their paths all intertwine, it certainly can't mean good news for any of them, least of all the object of their respective desire.When I reached this movie in my Disney source material read-through, I was glad for the opportunity to read this old favorite. I don't know what it is about this book (or this edition, which is abridged and therefore probably much shorter than the more or less "original"), but it has always left an impression on me, even from the first time I read it half my lifetime ago. (I might even like it better than Victor Hugo's other, even more famous novel...) It's an interesting mix of drama and humor, and the characters are numerous and diverse enough to keep the plot moving along. Frollo is an interesting villain, probably more interesting than his somewhat caricatured animated interpretation, as he really does seem to want to do the right thing, but he's completely intoxicated by poor, unassuming Esmeralda. As a heroine, the accidental gypsy girl is interesting, because she's not nearly as fiery as more recent adaptations have made her out to be, and she actually personifies virtue and has a real, innocent desire to find herself and her family. Speaking of, without giving too much away, I think the subplots in this book are pretty predictable, but they're still set up and followed through in such a way that makes them satisfying. Regarding the other key players, Phoebus is truly a classic cad, selfish and egotistical and basically a pawn in the story, but the real star is of course the deaf, deformed, but always well-meaning hunchback himself. Quasimodo is a very unique literary hero, and not only because there are very few protagonists in classic literature with such obvious physical deformities. He's the ideal embodiment of not judging a book by its cover, of a hideous creature with a heart of gold. He wants so much to do right, not only by his newly found love, but also as a matter of obedience to his master, Frollo, to whom he is truly devoted. Rounding out the cast are Clopin, Gringoire, young Jehan Frollo, and I think it's just the right combination of characters to provide just the right tone for this story. The writing (of this translation) is readable and natural, feels ancient but somehow also current, and makes the story feel as relevant now as when it was written or set.As far as Disney's adaptation goes, it's funny because reading through this time, I kept thinking to myself, who would read this and think, "hey, this would fit perfectly in Disney's animated canon!"? But the funny thing is that it does (some may disagree, which I can understand). I think as a book it works, but I think as a movie it also works. It maintains the gothic, epic, interpersonal feel of the novel while still adapting it for the art form and audience. It combines and eliminates characters, but there are a lot of elements that I think were worked into the movie's plot pretty effectively (like certain character attributes, a dancing goat, business in the final battle at Notre Dame, a very agile and even graceful hunchback, and yes, even talking gargoyles). It's in many ways an artistic masterpiece, and I've always loved it, but I think I love the book for different reasons.I don't know how many books I've read several times, but for whatever reason this is one of them. It has stayed with me over the years, and every time I read it I enjoy it. It has a compelling mix of fascinating characters, all embodying some aspect(s) of human nature, which is always interesting to me. One day maybe I'll read a maybe more faithful translation, but in the meantime I'm glad to have this edition in my library.
167`4`Is it bad I kinda like the Disney adaptation more?I buddy read this with Nana, though it was a reread for her..The Writing.I really don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm perpetually surprised when classics read like regular books. Maybe it‚Äôs simply because they‚Äôve been lauded and put up on this pedestal, so they have to be so different. But no, they follow the same schemes of style as every other book, just with slightly more archaic language and unabashed use of the word ‚Äúejactulated‚Äù when describing someone speaking abruptly. Regardless, this was all-in-all a solid novel. It took you through many different characters and their lives in true Hugo fashion, touching on almost every aspect of society. It also, in true Hugo fashion, ends with a lot of deaths, but what was I really expecting?Honestly, the only thing that really bothered me was those overly long interludes solely about irrelevant historical facts. They didn‚Äôt add anything to the story, and when they did (if ever) become relevant, they were simply reiterated. I understand that this novel helped encourage historical architectural preservation (and basically saved Notre Dame itself; oof Hugo must be rolling in his grave after the fire üò¨) but was it really necessary to go on a tangent for 2 hours about the fashion of the era and how some building was constructed? I‚Äôm here for dramatic irony, not an education, dang it!And, while enjoyable enough, what was up with that entire section dedicated to the King? I feel like it went on slightly too long, though it did increase my suspense nicely..Love is like a tree: it grows by itself, roots itself deeply in our being and continues to flourish over a heart in ruin. The inexplicable fact is that the blinder it is, the more tenacious it is. It is never stronger than when it is completely unreasonable...The Characters.La Esmeralda: Can this girl shut up about Phoebus????? If she wasn‚Äôt such an obsessed, naive idiot then she‚Äôd have saved everyone a whole world of hurt. I honestly don‚Äôt have a lot of sympathy for her, which surprised me, as her Disney counterpart is one of my favorite characters of all time. I understand that she‚Äôs very young, but 15/16 is old enough to know when a guy just isn‚Äôt interested. She honestly reminded me of Eponine from Les Mis√©rables and that girl annoyed the heck out of me. I did appreciate the thing that happened at the end, as I saw it coming and it was a great moment of catharsis (especially for a Hugo novel, because you never know if these things will actually happen or just be dramatically ironic and ruin your life). But then she destroyed it as she‚Äôs wont to do.Phoebus: This dude was a classic f-boy and I absolutely loved it. Everything about him, from his pompous arrogance to his idiocy was hilarious. Perhaps the reason I‚Äôm okay with him but not with Esmeralda‚Äôs antics is that he‚Äôs true to himself and his actions don‚Äôt necessarily put anyone in harm‚Äôs way, besides being the impetus for Frollo‚Äôs and Esmeralda‚Äôs story (but they could have stopped at any time but I digress) And that final stinger about him really gets me rolling.Quasimodo: He was endearing and likable, but I didn‚Äôt connect to his character as much as I was hoping to. Perhaps because he was so enamored with Esmeralda even though she‚Äôs kind of the worst.Frollo: Perhaps the most disappointing character of all. Is it a sin to say that I prefer almost every other interpretation of this character to the wimpy, whiny mess of a man I got in the original novel? He‚Äôs fascinating on a structural level, but in actuality, he kind of annoyed me more than he intrigued me. He‚Äôs honestly the crying Toby Maguire of Frollo‚Äôs and it‚Äôs kind of sad more than anything. As far as humanized villains go, though, I appreciated him for what he was.Pierre Gringore: Hands down my favorite character, possibly ever. I absolutely love this man. He‚Äôs a total riot and his nonchalant ability to get out of any unfortunate situation by simply talking long enough really kept me going in this book. And the ongoing joke about how much he loves Djali was the best thing ever. Honestly, I‚Äôm so surprised why he doesn‚Äôt feature in a lot of adaptations, namely the Disney one. His inherent humor would have meshed really well (and maybe they could have cut those gargoyles lol).Conclusion.I know it sounds like I didn‚Äôt like this book. But I did, really! The narrative voice was so engaging, Gringore so hilarious, the philosophical musing so relevant, and the setting so evocative, that I had an overall great time. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll enjoy this more on a second go. For now, I‚Äôm gonna rewatch the Disney movie and wonder for the millionth time why they made Frollo more evil and NSFW when it‚Äôs a children‚Äôs movie ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
168`5`Is the goodness in the eye of the beholder?
169`5`Is there a 6th star to add?
170`4`It has lengthy descriptions which get tedious but the story line is good. I love reading it in the original French. Something is lost in translation...
171`5`It hurts so good. I hate almost everyone in this book except Esmeralda and the goat, but unlike other French classics I've read lately *cough cough MUSKETEERS cough cough* Hugo doesn't expect you to like the assholes. I absolutely recommend this, especially if you haven't read anything by Hugo yet - it's easier to get through than Les Mis. Also, for my dudes out there, you should probably treat this as a lithmus test. If you feel deep sympathy with Frollo, his brother, Phoebus or the poet, then you really need to evaluate your life choices and your treatment of women.
172`null`It is a very good book.
173`5`It is absolutely the best book I've ever read. I am not interested in architecture but I didn't pass the levels of architectural analysis. I am still a young book reader so I didn't pay much attention to the architecural analysis,just read it, but I loved the whole story. By the descriptions of this time's Paris I felt that I was in that France. Frolo was the character that made me think more than any other. He was so evil but did he have this characteristic by the time he was born or did the need of being the mature brother and grow his brother make his heart hard as a rock? 
174`4`It's a classic novel. Beautifully written by Victor Hugo. The edition I have includes illustrations too. This thing make this book more interesting to read. Talking about the story, it's a story of many characters mainly of the Hunchback, the Gypsy Girl, an old Lady, and a priest. It still have some other supportive characters and the whole story revolves around them. I don't want to put spoilers in this story so I will just tell you this that the story has focused on kind of love. Like, one-sided crazy love, one love for lover, one love for children. So, I would recommend you this book. Please go for it. üòä
175`5`It's one of the most devastating books I've ever read. Makes one ponder the vicissitudes of fate. What begins as a lively and involving tale ends as a bitter tragedy. The book ends on an almost determinist note, seeing as how we are but beasts caught in the orbit of the wheel of Destiny.It's cruel, uplifting, savage, romantic, inexorable, and strangely hopeful. It deserves its place among France's immortal classics, and I'm looking forward to reading it again. I especially enjoyed the cameo of my favorite monarch, the crafty Louis XI, L'Universelle Araign√©e. Giving it my first perfect 10/10.
176`4`It‚Äôs not Les Miserables, but it‚Äôs worth reading.
177`4`It‚Äôs quite a few years since I last listened to an audio book. Years ago I used to take out audiobooks on CD from my local library and listen to them when I was driving, but then car manufacturers stopped putting CD players in cars, and for various reasons I didn‚Äôt get into the habit of listening to audiobooks via downloads, until now. There‚Äôs a moderate but limited selection available from same library, so I decided to start with Victor Hugo‚Äôs meandering but majestic novel, which I‚Äôd never before read. I listened to this in English translation, and I daresay something of the book may have been lost in that. I suspect that if I had tried to read this rather than listen to it, I might have given up in the early stages, since the opening section featuring Pierre Gringoire‚Äôs play seemed rambling and initially directionless. Moreover, I hadn‚Äôt realised that Victor Hugo had an interest in architecture that bordered on the obsessional. Entire chapters of the book are taken up with the architectural history of Notre Dame de Paris, the architecture of old Paris, and the role of architecture in culture. I found the last of these was a bit of a struggle to get through.But I was won over by the story, which is magnificent. With four thousand reviews on this site at the time of writing, I‚Äôm not going to spend too much time on adding comments. The complex and interconnected stories of the main characters; the memorable characters themselves; the fantastic descriptions of medieval Paris; the two stories of romantic obsession; the associated story of controlling sexual obsession; and the sense of inexorable fate within the novel; altogether make it easy to see why this has become one of the most famous tales of all time. Stick with it, and it all comes together!
178`3`I‚Äôm not finishing this for the time being. I read half of it and wanted to rip my hair out. I love Les Mis, mind you. I read the entire thing. Hunchback is so depressing and so confusing and so full of extraneous detail I just can‚Äôt get through it right now. Will I finish it someday? Maybe, probably.
179`4`Kitaptaki dipnotlar olduk√ßa bilgilendirici olmu≈ü.
180`2`La historia y los personajes me gustaron, el problema es la cantidad de descripciones que cortan la din√°mica de la novela, los cap√≠tulos "de relleno" y lo mucho que el autor se centra en personajes secundarios que al final no aportan tanto.
181`4`Les Mis√©rables has been gathering dust until I finally find the strenght to start, I thought The Hunchback of Notre Dame would be a nice warm up before that. ANd it was AWESOME! Some descriptions might run a bit long ( I see you Hugo and your 20 pages long chapter of description of notre Dame architecture) but putting that aside, it was incredible! People are saying Hugo is dull and even though I'm not a fan of his poetry this is so not the case for his novel: it has some incredible nuggets of humor (admitted, sometime very dark humor). Forget the Disney's version (which is incredible in its own right!) because the plot and characters are vastly different and once you do that, you can enjoy your ride! 
182`4`Lido em Abril 2019. Traduzido para portugu√™s por Jos√© da Natividade Gaspar.Livraria Civiliza√ß√£o - Editora. Fevereiro de 1982
183`5`Like a lot of other GRers, I had a hard time getting into the The Hunchback Of Notre Dame by Victor Hugo. Hugo writes with such detail, mainly about architecture through the first third of the book. I had to make myself continue reading (and resist skimming). I liked the reading and love European architecture, but so found it a bit much.The story of Quasimodo and Esmeralda is far more engrossing and once I got about halfway through, i had a hard time putting the book down. I have never seen the Disney version of this movie and am quite frankly, puzzled that this would be made into a children's film. The book is so tragic and so sad. I'm sure there were many changes made to the story but I think I'll skip the Disney movie. I do want to rent the Charles Lautner version of the film after reading this book though. I've been wanting to read Les Miserables for some time but am wondering if Hugo "goes on" about any topic like he does with architecture in this novel. In a 500 page books it's one thing, but in a tome like Les Mis, I don't know if I could do it.This book had some really beautiful writing. "He remained thus for more than an hour, motionless, with his eye fixed upon the empty cell, more gloomy and more pensive than a mother seated between an empty cradle and a full coffin. He uttered not a word; only at intervals, a violent sob racked his body, but it was sobbing without tears, like summer lighting flashes with no rumbling." p.490
184`4`Long winded and overdone in areas like only the classics can be, it was good to finally read this and dispell the idyllic world that Disney portrayed. But now all I want to do is watch the movie...you win again, Walt!
185`4`Lots to love here: the scope, the extensive (and fairly mad) asides about architecture, history of Paris, alchemy... almost everything and anything that strikes Hugo's fancy. The book may be disorganized and hard to get trough because of its rambling nature, but so worth it.The last hundred pages or so are very powerful. They build towards the inevitable disasters with a force of a Greek tragedy. Good stuff.
186`5`Loved it, simply.
187`3`Many approaching this story for the first time will be misled before even having turned the first page. For unlike what the titles of foreign translations and Disney adaptations would have you believe, it is not the Hunchback, but the Cathedral that is the central character in the story. Notre-Dame is presented here as Paris‚Äô beating heart, a refuge for the downtrodden cast of orphans ‚Äì Quasimodo, Frollo, Esmeralda, Gringoire ‚Äì that constitute the story‚Äôs central characters, and a witness to the unrelenting passage of time in the city‚Äôs history. This alone should explain to those who watched Notre-Dame burn from outside the borders of l‚Äôhexagone this year why the event was such a tragedy: ‚ÄúChaque face, chaque pierre du v√©n√©rable monument est une page non seulement de l'histoire du pays, mais encore de l'histoire de la science et de l‚Äôart.‚ÄùAnyone looking to understand the novel need not read past the preface. Here, Hugo draws the reader‚Äôs attention to a word (since erased by the hand of time) etched in the stone wall of the Cathedral: Ananke ‚Äì fate, inevitability, constraint, necessity. ‚ÄúC‚Äôest sur ce mot qu‚Äôon a fait ce livre‚Äù. Indeed, Hugo tells us that it is not just man that is subject to Ananke. ‚ÄúCeci remplacera cela‚Äù, Dom Frollo warns. Ananke makes no exceptions for the strong, the bold, the innocent, or the righteous: bones turn to dust, words etched into stone come to fade, ‚Äúet l‚Äô√©glise elle-m√™me s‚Äôeffacera [‚Ä¶] de la terre‚Äù.
188`3`Me gust√≥ el libro, aunque al intentar leerlo en el idioma original y sobre todo al ser del siglo diecinueve, se me hizo algo pesado y largo. Dif√≠cil de leer, pero dir√≠a que es un buen libro, aunque tal vez no de los mejores de Victor Hugo.
189`null`Melodramatic historical novel set in late medieval Paris.Read it once some years ago, it was a Christmas gift, and was disappointed by it - I was expecting something different I suppose, in my innocence I could not even conceive then that Victor Hugo was none other than the fabled Mr Melodrama himself, which is possibly why in his house on Guernsey he had carpet on the ceiling. On the one hand the elder brothers infatuation I felt should have lead to something more psychologically intense while on the other the description of the bandits and of the King with his captives kept in cages hanging from the ceiling of his great hall had more of a comic tone. I felt the book was stuck somewhere uncomfortable between the irrepressible exuberance of Robert Louis Stevenson and the Romantic tartan nostalgia of Walter Scott. Mind you I also disliked  Les Miserables, at some point you do need to learn from your own reading experiences.Something you have to be at the right age or in the right mood to read possibly.
190`4`Melodramatic, to be sure, and fraught with astonishing coincidences -- but of course, and why not? Still, an engrossing read. Flashes of brilliance, plenty of pathos. Memorable characters, even if they did ramble on a bit much. A story thick with irony as the tragedy unfolds. Of course, we have to be careful when we apply modern aesthetics for the novel to touchstone 19th Century titles that were influential in shaping the novel to be come what we now prefer it to be. In other words, while we're welcome to prefer Dickens less for stylistic choices we now eschew, we have to remember that he, and Hugo, and others of their century were largely responsible for bequeathing to us the novel as we know it. Perhaps this critique is also attributable to the novel's place in history and culture. Even so. Though it followed Claude Frollo's point of view much of the time, I still wished the novel hadn't, shall we say, relished so much in his voyeurism and rape fantasies. I felt as though the novel itself was complicit in the violation of La Esmeralda. It did, however, give her as much subjectivity as objectivity, or at least nearly so. She was allowed to be a strong and sympathetic character in her own right, and in some sense as much a victim of her passions as Dom Claude was of his. Victim in the tragic sense -- I give him no free passes whatsoever for his rottenness. 
191`2`Mi dispiace un p√≤ scriverlo ma questo libro mi ha davvero deluso, i fatti infine sono davvero pochi, troppe descrizioni architettoniche, della Parigi dell'epoca,povert√†, depressione, stregonerie e strane credenze... interi capitoli bloccati dove non succede niente.I personaggi sono ben descritti e ben fatti, ma alla fine sono solo uno sfondo della cattedrale...La scena pi√π bella √® stata quella quando Esmeralda riconosce sua madre e la ritrova dopo anni, una scena davvero toccante...il resto...Il finale poi...che dire sono morti tutti..meglio il film Disney...mi dispiace Victor Hugo...
192`4`Missed reading this classic in my childhood, so decided to take it up now. While its a pleasant read, some of the portions are really dark with elaborate descriptions on gargoyles, brutal mobs etc.
193`3`Mixed feelings and feel a bit daft giving this a 3/5, BUT I feel it's very important to stress, you either write a novel, or you write a history of Paris/France in the 1400s. By doing both, you're probably pissing off those that don't like novels, or those that don't like history. And that's a recipe for criticism.The novel-ly bits were good though. But Esmerelda is a pathetic character. Thank you we got Les Mis later or I'd be calling Hugo a misogynist.
194`5`Much better than I expected. Nobody writes like Hugo anymore. The language and the scenes are spellbinding.....I found myself reading sections of it aloud just to hear the lyrical magic of the prose....
195`3`My first time going through any edition (besides the Disney version). Some of the pictures were pretty dark (hard to see).
196`5`NO SPOILERS HEREAlright, lets get one thing straight. (Wow, am I really using clich√© opening lines now?)Fine I'll just say it: I LOVE THIS BOOK.And that's all you need to know until you read it.The end.
197`5`NOT FOR CHILDREN TO READreview of Victor Hugo's "Notre-Dame" & "The History of a Crime: The Testimony of an Eye-Witness" by tENTATIVELY, a cONVENIENCE - May 27, 2017 The full review is here: https://www.goodreads.com/story/show/... I picked up this 1898ish hardback edition of The Novels of Victor Hugo: Volume I for something like a dollar. Life is good. It's published by P. F. Collier & is "profusely illustrated with elegant wood engravings" wch are, yes, really something to behold. I decided to read it partially just to hold this old hardback bk in my hands. The physical feel of the bk alone does it for me. Hugo lived from February 26, 1802 to May 22, 1885 so this bk was only published 13 yrs after his death. There's something special about that. In Andr√© Breton's 1st Surrealist Manifesto he declares that "Hugo is Surrealist when he isn't stupid." (p 27, Manifestoes of Surrealism, The University of Michigan Press, 1969 - original manifesto: 1924) What he meant by that is unclear to me. Having read 3 of Hugo's bks now I wdn't call any of them Surrealist or stupid so I have to wonder if Breton wasn't just trying to rope Hugo into a lineage of his creation w/ a disclaimer added on to protect his own interests. I'd previously read Notre-Dame under the title The Hunch-Back of Notre-Dame in a goat-skin bound 1928 edition from Walter J. Black, Inc, but I wasn't sure whether this was the same story or not so it seemed worth the dollar I forked over. I'd also read Hugo's The Toilers of the Sea. I read them over 40 yrs ago so my memories of both were dim. The Hunch-Back of Notre-Dame I probably remembered more from the film starring Lon Chaney. At any rate, as I discovered whilst rereading it, I really remembered almost nothing about it & it's a much richer bk than my sketchy outline recalled. This bk was written at a time when people who were lucky enuf to get an education were taught Greek & Latin. As such, it's not uncommon to find things written in both languages in bks w/o any translation provided: "AUTHOR'S PREFACE. "Some years ag, while visiting the Cathedral of Notre-Dame, or, to speak more properly, exploring every corner of it, the author of this book discovered, in a dark corner in one of the towers, this word, in Greek capital letters, engraven upon the wall‚Äî 'ANA'TKH. [Not quite - what I've written as a "T" is missing its left horizontal] These characters, black with age and deeply cut into the stone, with certain peculiarities of form and posture belonging to the Gothic calligraphy, as if to declare that they had been traced there by some hand of the middle ages‚Äîand, above all, the dismal and fatal meaning they conveyed‚Äîstruck the author forcibly." - p 5 Yes, but what does it mean?! This question, regarding the above passage, had already been asked of Yahoo Answers & produced "need", seemingly the most accurate answer, & "anarchy", seemingly a mistranslation. Don't ask me, I just work here. "Yet the 6th of January, 1482, was not a day of which history has preserved any record." - p 5 Ok, I'll bite, I looked-it-up-online & the 1st entry refers to the Hugo novel & to the annual Feast of Fools, a popular medieval festival. A Day of the Week website informs me it was a Friday. I didn't find anything historical for that date so Hugo chose it well. My memory of The Hunch-Back of Notre-Dame had little more in it than the hunch-back bell-ringer of the famous church rescuing a gypsy girl & protecting her by pouring boiling oil off the ramparts of the church. That memory turns out to be more than a little defective. A substantial part of the beginning of the novel is detailed descriptions of the history of Paris of the time. It's evident that Hugo did extensive research (or faked it, wch seems considerably less likely) & went to great effort to establish the scene. "It is certain that if Ravaillac had not assassinated Henry IV., there would have been no documents relative to the trial of Ravaillac deposited in the registry of the Palais de Justice, no accomplices interested in causing the disappearance of the said documents, and therefore no incendiaries obliged, for want of any better expedient, to burn the registry for the sake of burning the documents, and to burn the Palais de Justice for the sake of burning the registry‚Äîin short, no fire of 1618." - p 7 Thusly showing the difficulty of some of his research. Hugo puts some interesting speech in the mouths of his characters. Here's "the sworn bookseller to the University" speaking: '""I tell you monsieur, the world's at an end. Never were there such breakings-out of the scholars ! It's the accursed inventions of the age that are ruining everything‚Äîthe artillery‚Äîthe serpentines‚Äîthe bombards‚Äîand, above all, the printing-press, that German pest ! No more manuscripts‚Äîno more books ! Printing puts an end to bookselling‚Äîthe end of the world is coming !"" - p 12 Interesting, isn't it? Hugo reminds us that there was a time when book-selling was a matter of selling manuscripts to universities, presumably for high prices based on rarity. The arrival of mass-production wd dramatically change all that. To most of 'us', the invention of the printing press marks the beginning of the era of bks. Hugo is a very dramatic socio-political observer. The only bk that I can recall reading prior to this that rivals it in melodrama was Eugene Sue's The Wandering Jew, a bk that has such a sheer length of doom for its characters that it may still be unsurpassed for me. Still, Notre-Dame may have a similar quantity of misery but it's more compacted, the misery moves along at a quicker pace. It interested me to read in the 2nd bk of this volume, The History of a Crime: The Testimony of an Eye-Witness that Sue was in politics at the same level that Hugo was. ""No ! Croix-Dieu !" he cried, with his voice of thunder : Jacques Coppenole, hosier. Dost thou hear, usher ? Neither more nor less. Croix-Dieu ! a hosier‚Äîthat's fine enough. Monsieur the archduke has more than once looked for his gant in my hose." "This play upon the word gant, a glove, pronounced exactly alike Gand or Ghent, the great manufacturing town in Flanders, occasioned a burst of laughter and applause from the people below. "We must add that Coppenole was one of the people, and that the auditory around him were of the people also ; so that the communication between them and him had been quick, electric, and, as it were, on equal footing. This lofty air which the Flemish hosier gave himself, by humbling the courtiers, had stirred in the plebeian breasts a certain latent feeling of dignity." - p 22 Keep in mind that Hugo was of the period immediately following the French Revolution. The revolution was from 1798 to 1799 & Hugo was born in 1802. Notre-Dame was written in 1831. According to Wikipedia's entry on Hugo: "Though a committed royalist when he was young, Hugo's views changed as the decades passed, and he became a passionate supporter of republicanism. His work touches upon most of the political and social issues and the artistic trends of his time." I'm a little confused by that since he wd've been 29 when he wrote Notre-Dame & since I'd hardly call it "royalist" so if "decades" had to pass to make him not a royalist here does that mean that he was a passionate royalist when he was 9? Here's an example of what I'd call a parody of the king's viciousness: "The king reascended in silence to his closet, followed by the persons of his train, horror-struck at the last groanings of the condemned. All at once his majesty turned round to the Givernor of the Bastille. "By-the-by," said he, "was theree not someone in that cage?" ""Par-Dieu, yes, sire!" answered the governor astounded at the question. ""And who, pray?" ""Monsieur, the Bishop of Verdun." "The king knew that better than any one else, but this was a mania of his." - p 225 To quote Wikipedia's entry again: "In 1848, Hugo was elected to the National Assembly of the Second Republic as a conservative. In 1849, he broke with the conservatives when he gave a noted speech calling for the end of misery and poverty. Other speeches called for universal suffrage and free education for all children. Hugo's advocacy to abolish the death penalty was renowned internationally." Those details may not be germane to Notre-Dame but they're definitely germane to The History of a Crime & they seem implied, to me at least, in Notre-Dame. If there's any conservatism in Notre-Dame I'm not able to recognize it as such. More than anything else, it's a very grim look at the ways-in-wch-things-can-be-stupid-thanks-to-the-follies-of-human-nature-&-the-struggles-for-power. If slaughter can happen b/c of misunderstandings & bull-headedness (sorry, bulls, it's more human-headedness but the readers wdn't understand that expression) it will. More or less every person in the story is ironically wrong in some fashion or another & there's plenty of misery & death for innocents. Notre-Dame was so different than my memory of it that I wasn't sure it was the same as The Hunch-Back of Notre-Dame that I'd already read & thought it might be a precursor or sequel to it. THEN, along came CHAPTER V: "Quasimodo, the Hunchback" (p 27) in wch he was chosen to be Pope of Fools: "The acclamation was unanimous ; the crowd rushed toward the chapel, and the blessed pope of the fools was led out in triumph. And now the surprise and admiration of the people rose still higher, for they found the wondrous grin to be nothing but his ordinary face." - p 29 Perhaps the most charming characters, the most guilt-free ones, &, therefore, the ones DOOMED, are the gypsy girl & her intelligent trained goat: ""Djali!" cried the gypsy. "Gringoire then saw come up to her a little white she-goat, lively, brisk, and glossy, with gilt horns, gilt feet, and a gilt collar, which he had not before observed ; as, until that moment it had been lying squat upon one corner of the carpet, looking at his mistress dance." [It's a "she-goat" but it's watching "his" mistress dance? Wassup w/ that?!] ""Djali," said the dancer, "it's your turn now ; " and sitting down, she gracefully held out her tambourine to the goat. "Djali," she continued, "what month of the year is this?" "The animal lifted its fore foot and struck one stroke upon the tambourine. It was, in fact, the first month of the year. The crowd applauded. ""Djali ! " resumed the girl, turning her tambourine another way, "what day of the month is it?" "Djali lifted her little golden foot, and struck six times upon the tambourine." - p 36 Now, I don't want to give too much away of the story, for those of you who might read it, but I do want to say that it's a tragedy &, as w/ most or all tragedies, it's based on an ongoing series of misunderstandings - many of wch wdn't be easily corrected b/c of things like Quasimodo's deafness or the main priest character's personality-as-warped-by-religion. Hugo clearly wants the reader to love the gypsy girl & her goat & to see how the whole confused & corrupted & demented society will inevitably scapegoat them both b/c it's not capable of getting out of its own cesspit of stupidity. No-one but the author, apparently, is capable of a detached enuf perspective to see how it all clashes blindly. A character, initially presented as potentially sympathetic, ends up going into the wrong neighborhood: ""Onde vas, hombre?" cried the wooden legs, throwing aside his scaffolding, and running after him with as good a pair of legs as ever measured a geometrical pace upon the pavement of Paris. Meanwhile, the stump-man, erect upon his feet, clapped his heavy iron-sheathed platter upon his head, while the blind man stared him in the face with great flaming eyes. ""Where am I?" said the terrified poet. ""In the Court of Miracles," answered a fourth specter who had accosted them." - p 45 The poet, Pierre Gringoire, our potentially sympathetic character, who later turns out to be a fool & a coward tells a bit of his history: "My father was hanged by the Burgundians, and my mother ripped open by the Picards, at the time of the siege of Paris twenty years ago." - p 57 That seems about as miserable as living in Northern Ireland in the 1980s. In Hugo's prolonged description of Paris, in general, & Notre-Dame, in particular, the reader learns of Notre-Dame's history beyond the time of the novel: "Thus, to sum up the points which we have here laid down, three kinds of ravages now disfigure Gothic architecture : wrinkles and knobs on the surface‚Äîthese are the work of time : violences, brutalities, contusions, fractures‚Äîthese are the work of revolutions, from Luther down to Mirabeau : mutilations, amputations, dislocation of members, restorations‚Äîthese are the labors, Grecian, Roman, and barbaric, of the professors according to Vitruvius and Vignola. That magnificent art which the Vandals had produced, the academies have murdered. To the operations of ages and of revolutions, which, at all events, devastate with impartiality and grandeur, have been added those of the cloud of school-trained architects, licensed, privileged, and patented, degrading with all the discernment and selection of bad taste‚Äîsubstituting, for instance, the chichor√©es of Louis XV, for the Gothic lacework, to the greater glory of the Parthenon. This is the kick of the ass at the expiring lion. 'Tis the old oak which, in the last stage of decay, is stung and gnawed by the caterpillars." - pp 60-61 Back to Paris & the cathedral at the time of the novel: "Now what aspect did all this present when viewed from the top of the towers of Notre-Dame in 1482 ? We will endeavor to describe it. "The spectator, on arriving, out of breath, upon this summit, was first of all struck by a dazzling confusion of roofs, chimneys, streets, bridges, squares, spires, steeples. All burst upon the eye at once‚Äîthe formally-cut gable, the acute-angled roofing, the hanging turret at the angles of the walls, the stone pyramid of the eleventh century, the slate obelisk of the fifteenth ; the donjon tower, round and bare; the church tower, square and decorated ; the large and the small, the massive and the airy. The gaze was for some time utterly bewildered by this labyrinth;" - p 66 Hugo was trying to describe Paris as seen from on top of Notre-Dame but writing 349 yrs later. That's no small feat & my admiration for the seriousness w/ wch he approached this daunting task is considerable. Another main character is Frollo, the priest who kindly adopts & names Quasimodo & saves him from an even more ignominious life than he eventually suffers thru. he has many good characteristics but his priestly unnatural suppression of his sexual instincts leads to his downfall & to the downfall of others around him. At 1st, his future seems bright: "Having digested the decretals, he plunged into medicine and the liberal arts, He studied the science of herbs, the science of unguents. He became expert in the treatment of fevers and of contusions, of wounds and of imposthumes. Jacques d'Espars would have admitted him as a physician ; Richard Hellain, as a surgeon. In like manner he ran through every degree in the faculty of the arts. He studied the languages Latin, Greek, Hebrew ; a triple sanctuary, then but very little frequented. He was possessed by an absolute fever of acquiring and storing up science. At eighteen, he had made his way through the four faculties ; it seemed to the young man that life had but one sole object, and that was, to know." - p 80 "impostume"? An "archaic word for abscess" according to Dictionary.com. Quasimodo is the Notre-Dame bell-ringer. Too bad Frollo didn't have enuf sense to get him to protect his ears b/c bells are damned loud &, yeah, anyone who rings them at close hand is going to get deaf if they aren't cautious. That's one of the reasons why there're keyboards for ringing the bells located a safe distance away. "It is true that their voices were the only ones that he was still capable of hearing. On this account, the great bell of all as is best beloved. She it was whom he preferred among this family of noisy sisters that fluttered about him on festival days. This great bell was named Marie. She was placed in the southern tower, where she had no companion but her sister Jacqueline, a bell of smaller dimensions, shut up in a smaller cage by the side of her own. This Jacqueline was so named after the wife of Jean Montagu, which Jean had given to the church‚Äîa donation, however, which had not prevented him from going out and figuring without his head at Montfaucon. In the northern tower were six other bells ; while the six smallest inhabited the central steeple, over the choir, together with the wooden bell, which was rung only from the afternoon of Maunday-Thursday until the morning of Holy Saturday, ir Easter-eve, Thus Quasimodo had fifteen bells in his seraglio ; but Big Marie was his favorite." - p 84 This deafness in a societal reject, an outsider, is neither much noticed or cared about. When Quasimodo is taken to trial he & his judge both are deaf wch results in total injustice as neither deafness is acknowledged & miscommunication & classism rules: "["]Registrar, have you taken down what the prisoner has said so far?" "At this unlucky question a burst of laughter was heard, caught by the audience from the registrar‚Äîso violent, so uncontrollable, so contagious, so universal, that neither of the deaf men could help perceiving it. Quasimodo turned round, shrugging up his hump in disdain ; while Maitre Florian, astonished like himself, and supposing that the laughter of the spectators had been excited by some irreverent reply from the accused, rendered himself visible to him by that shrug, apostrophized him indignantly. ""Fellow," said he, "you gave me an answer then that deserves the halter. Know you to whom you are speaking?"" - p 95 I wonder if Hugo had actually witnessed a scene like this or heard tell of one. I was in a courtrm once when a man was charged w/ sleeping on a park bench. When asked what he had to say for himself, he explained that he'd just eaten some food out of the trash can by the McDonald's & that he'd uncontrollably fallen asleep. It was immediately obvious to me that he was hypoglycemic & that that caused him to sleep when he probably wd've been content w/ just sitting in the park. He was sentenced to something like a mnth in jail. The whole process was very perfunctory - & this was in the 20th century, not the Middle Ages.
198`4`None of the characters are likeable except Quasimodo, and even he is shallow enough to fall in love with a nitwit just because she's beautiful. I give it four stars because everyone gets their just rewards.
199`4`Not as good as Les Mis but great nevertheless. Though the passages about medieval Paris architecture may only interest those who adore the city or architecture in general. I personally loved the whole package. The characters are legendary and one of the best ever invented.
200`3`Not only did Victor Hugo tell an epic story that contained several lessons in morality, but he also documented the history of Paris and its architecture.Hugo actually spent 2 years researching the history of Paris, studying dress, food, drink, songs, stories, and locale.The story in itself is nice, but severely depressing. But what I really couldn't understand is HOW THE FUCK DID DISNEY DECIDE TO MAKE THIS A CHILDREN CARTOON?!! Hell, lust, sexual harassment, prostitution, racism, torture, stabbing, child kidnapping, death, and execution. Gee, that could make up a fucking good premise for a fucking Disney movie.
201`5`Notre Dame, the great cathedral of central Paris, gave Victor Hugo‚Äôs 1831 novel its original title. We in the English-speaking world know the book as The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and tend to focus on the character of Quasimodo, the bell-ringer whose physical deformities conceal a brave and kind heart. The reason for the confusion of titles is quite simple: the book‚Äôs English translator, working in a time when literary Gothicism was highly popular, simply retitled the novel for its first English-language publication in 1833, figuring no doubt that a book named after a hunchback would sell more copies than a book named after a cathedral.As titles go, however, Notre Dame de Paris is truer to the spirit of what Hugo wanted his novel to provide ‚Äì a grand, epic look at life in medieval Paris, unified around the cathedral that has been overlooking Parisian life from the √éle de la Cit√© ever since its completion in 1345. The novel‚Äôs action takes place during the late-15th-century reign of King Louis XI, at a time when Notre Dame was just over a century old. By 1831, however, Notre Dame was showing her age; she had suffered significant damage from anti-clerical rioters during the French Revolution, and Hugo was concerned that many of Paris‚Äôs treasures of Gothic architecture might be permitted to crumble into dust. It is for that reason that Hugo includes in the novel extensive passages like this one in support and defense of Gothic masterpieces like Notre Dame: ‚Äú[T]hree kinds of ravages nowadays disfigure Gothic architecture: wrinkles and warts on the skin ‚Äì these are the work of Time; wounds, contusions, fractures, from brutal violence ‚Äì these are the work of revolutions from Luther to Mirabeau; mutilations, amputations, dislocations of limbs, restorations -- this is the barbarous Greek and Roman work of professors.‚Äù Read this book as Notre Dame de Paris, looking at all the characters in terms of how their lives relate to the life of the cathedral ‚Äì rather than focusing solely on one (albeit undeniably interesting) character ‚Äì and you will suddenly find that you are reading an entirely different, and much richer, novel.You‚Äôll still get to spend time with the same unforgettable characters, of course. Pierre Gringoire, the aspiring poet, may reflect Hugo‚Äôs own belief in the power of words and literature to bring about positive change. There is pathos in Gringoire‚Äôs hopeless love for the Romani (‚ÄúGypsy‚Äù) woman Esmeralda; Hugo, whose liberal and reformist frame of mind made him sympathize with all who suffered oppression, focuses on the anti-‚ÄúGypsy‚Äù prejudice among the people of medieval Paris, as when the character of Gervaise says that the Romani people‚Äôs ‚Äúteeth are long enough to eat little children. And I would not be surprised if La Esmeralda were to pick a bit now and then, though she has such a small, pretty mouth. Her white goat plays so many marvelous tricks that there must be something wrong at bottom.‚Äù I‚Äôve never seen this person do anything wrong, but she simply must be doing some awful thing, because it suits me to think so. Hugo captures the nature of prejudice in a single line of dialogue.It is Esmeralda‚Äôs fate to be beautiful, and ‚Äì paradoxically ‚Äì her misfortune to be loved. She is loved by Gringoire, whom she marries to save him from the wrath of the Truands, the professional criminals whose ‚ÄúCourt of Miracles‚Äù Gringoire accidentally wanders into; but she is indifferent to his love, and regards him only as a rather feckless friend. She is loved by Quasimodo the bell-ringer, who rescues her from execution in one of the novel‚Äôs most famous passages; and the feelings of pity that prompt her to bring water to Quasimodo during his public punishment in front of the church become feelings of appreciation and respect once he has saved her from execution. Most ominously, Esmeralda is loved ‚Äì or, more accurately, lusted after ‚Äì by the arch-deacon Frollo, a powerful church official whose vows of chastity go out the stain-glassed window once he has seen Esmeralda dance. A lifetime of repressed or suppressed lust seethes within Frollo, who at one point in the novel tells Esmeralda that her ‚Äúsuperhuman beauty‚Ä¶can come only from heaven or from hell‚Äù and concludes, unsurprisingly, that ‚ÄúI perceived the demon‚Äôs trap, and had no further doubt that you were from hell, and had come for my perdition.‚Äù A lust-racked man blames an innocent woman for the fact that he lusts after her, and intends to destroy her if he cannot have her. So little has changed since 1831, or since 1470, or since the first time a woman said ‚Äúno‚Äù to a man who desired her without loving her.But what of Esmeralda herself? She has a heart; whom does she love? Tragically, Esmeralda has given her heart to Captain Phoebus de Chateaupers. A bold cavalryman and leader of archers, Phoebus is a veritable Apollo for good looks and gallantry; but he is doubly well-named in that he is a false god whose reality belies his quasi-divine appearance. And Esmeralda‚Äôs idolatry for Phoebus betrays her at one crucial point in the novel.Hugo‚Äôs dedication to the liberal, democratic spirit of la R√©publique fran√ßaise emerges in his portrayal of King Louis XI. Known historically as le rus√© (‚Äúthe Cunning‚Äù) and l‚Äôuniverselle aragne (‚Äúthe Universal Spider‚Äù), King Louis emerges as a capricious figure, granting clemency and ordering executions as the whims of the moment move him. Esmeralda, rescued from execution by Quasimodo, enjoys the benefits of sanctuary within Notre Dame, but the king orders that ‚ÄúThe witch must be hanged‚Äù and subsequently asks the Virgin Mary to forgive him for violating the sanctuary of her cathedral, asking that she ‚ÄúForgive me then for this time, our Lady of Paris!‚Äù and assuring her that ‚ÄúI will never do so again, and I will give you a beautiful statue of silver, just like the one I gave last year to our Lady of Ecouys. Amen!‚Äù Thus, with a Judas Iscariot-like bribe of silver, the King of France is prepared to deliver an innocent woman over to the gallows. In the time when Notre Dame de Paris was published, the corrupt post-Napoleonic Bourbon dynasty had just been replaced by a constitutional monarchy; and in his portrayal of the King, Hugo makes clear his support for the spirit of Libert√©, √©galit√©, fraternit√©. In a novel filled with torture and brutality, some measure of justice is achieved; the cruel and hypocritical Frollo gets his comeuppance, and Gringoire‚Äôs belief that the power of words can outlast the power of physical force and compulsion gets some measure of vindication. But the cost in innocent human life, by novel‚Äôs end, is high; and with the novel‚Äôs final image, the reader is reminded in a moving way of Quasimodo‚Äôs pure, uncorrupted, hopeless love for the beautiful Esmeralda. Small wonder that Quasimodo has made such an impression upon generations of readers, or that he has been portrayed so memorably on screen by actors like Lon Chaney, Charles Laughton, Anthony Quinn, Anthony Hopkins, Tom Hulce, and Mandy Patinkin.I read Notre Dame de Paris on a trip to Paris in 2006. My bookmark for the novel is a boarding pass for the flight home (Air France 5870, Paris to Detroit; courteous flight attendants, good wine with dinner). I am typing this review two days after the Paris terror attacks. My impressions of Paris now are the same as my impressions of Paris back in 2006, as I walked the battlements of Notre Dame and looked out, from a gargoyle‚Äôs-eye view, upon la ville lumi√®re, the City of Lights. Hugo‚Äôs Notre Dame de Paris captures in 1831 what people all over the world know about Paris in 2015: that for all the tragedies and traumas that Paris has suffered over its long history, the spirit of Paris lives on, imperishable.
202`3`Notre-Dame de Paris is a very difficult novel to review. Certain prose were so eloquent and thoughtful that I was sure this was going to be a 5* read. Also, the general concept of the story and its portrayal of the different kinds of love was very well executed and interesting. However, there were other chapters that only contained swathes of geographical description that were bland and dull; they were the epitome of telling and not showing. Perhaps, it is an unfair criticism as the original title of this novel is Notre-Dame de Paris (and not the English translation of The Hunchback of Notre Dame), making such vast descriptions permissible.I will definitely be rereading Notre-Dame de Paris, with a better understanding of what to expect. 
203`4`Notre-Dame is a must read classic once you excuse the author for those frequent coincidence-induced weaknesses in the story.To start with, the story is beautifully written. There are hundreds of ageless quotable quotes strewn around; they spring from absolutely nowhere all through. The backdrop is a kind of realistic 14th century life that post 19th century authors will find impossible to create. The world before had different rhythm, logic, sensitivities and emotions that were somewhat remote even for Hugo but infinitely more distant by now. A modern reader may find many of the sentiments or dialogues laughable, but even not discounting for Hugo's excessive romanticism, the reality was likely much closer to what is depicted here than imagined these days.The archaic humanity with all the norms, beliefs, superstitions etc is portrayed brilliantly in numerous hues. Whether the two deafs struggling against each other in a courtroom or the Hollywood-isq rescue at the gallows, the mundane going ons at the king's residence or the society of the vagabonds, the fascination with alchemy or the festival of the fools, prisons and cathedrals, Paris from the eyes of kings, bishops, knights and thieves - the scenes are as otherworldly as their descriptions marvellous.There are flaws, particularly for us not used to the style and living in today's fast world. The book takes a long time - like those of Tolstoy - before the main characters or the main storyline become apparent. Some of the massively detailed descriptions are completely irrelevant although they are not without value for everyone. Overall, a genuine timeless epic.
204`4`Notre-Dame.The grandeur of the name alone is liable to overwhelm you. It might even send goosebumps all over your skin. What with the story surrounding it?There's a lovely description of Paris on the first page, bringing it exceptionally to life, it was so refreshing. But then, the narrative starts to drag on roughly through a series of bulky description giving exhaustive detail about:- The history of nearly everything - it almost transforms into a history book!- An army of characters and historical figures - it's fortunate that you get a grasp of who the five main characters are along the way!- There's so much talking among the extras - even redundant characters (annoying passersby) have a say in things ! Silence, tu es stupide!! X(There are numerous times between book 1 and 3 where I decided to put the book down. But in book 3, things started to get interesting, the narrative smoothed out and you finally get a sense of plot.Hugo certainly mastered characterization. You feel so engulfed by the main characters even the evil ones. I myself am amazed by Claude Frollo. Though the antagonist of the story, he was incredibly crafted. The circle that linked the characters was credible. I love how four characters were mesmerized by La Esmeralda, and each one expressed his devotion to her quite differently.I hope this doesn't come as a spoiler, but it's tragic how none of the men, despite their strong feelings for her, were unable to save her. Pheobus was the most annoying guy. Quasimodo, with his grotesque features, the softest. Gringoire is probably the funniest, I love how he becomes dispersed in an intangible land in the most critical of times! Esmeralda is young, feisty, (and as Alan Menkin put is: See the finest girl in France/ make an entrance to entrance), yet stupidly in love with the wrong man...The dominant theme, I believe, is that of darkness. Everything is engulfed by it. The shadows of the Cathedral, to the shadows within people. Then there's Notre-Dame. This is a place that is highly regarded throughout the story. A place of sanctuary, and, truly enough, of violations. The bells symbolize life to an almost dead city, a city engulfed with corruption and poverty. The darkness, the cold weather, the harsh living, the injustice, all those are likely to haunt you for days after you finish reading this. And, yes, I do recommend this book.
205`2`OK, so this is was the second time I have attempted to read this book. It probably won't be my last try, I do so hate to give up. Les Miserables is on my list of the 25 greatest novels, so it is not Hugo's writing style that puts me off, though he is a bit wordy in the description department. And that very this is my problem with this book. There is an entire chapter dedicated to the description of the Notre-Dame cathedral. I understand that this is the setting of most of the story, but 30 pages is a bit much for showing us the building and the surrounding neighborhood. Even Quasimodo takes a back stage to Notre-Dame as he isn't even introduced until the fifth chapter. I am not Frank Lloyd Wright, I want stories about people, not buildings. I guess I will just have to stick with the movie versions of the story. At least Lon Chaney and Charles Laughton never bored me. 
206`4`Oh my goodness! Where to begin... Overall, I really did enjoy this book- Hugo is such a gifted writer and I loved his descriptions about the Notre Dame cathedral, but the characters! Frollo is just as evil and creepy as the Disney movie version, but that's about where the similarities lay. As detestable as all the characters were (yes, even Esmerelda), I loved the story and the themes throughout the book.
207`5`Oh my goodness‚Äîthis story is so incredibly heartbreaking and beautiful! I read it to pay homage to the beautiful cathedral that recently was half destroyed by fire, and while Hugo didn‚Äôt skimp on descriptions of the architecture, I also got an incredible story. I need to let that ending settle before I finish my review.
208`5`Oh my heart. What a beautiful, gut-wrenching book. A friend put me on to the Disney adaptation (I know! How could that persuade anyone to read a classic! But Disney did a thoroughly respectable job on the story, despite Disney-fying Phoebus and the ending. The anti-hero, Claude Frollo, was remarkably faithful, if a little one-dimensional) and I was so taken by it and the music from 'Notre Dame de Paris', the stage adaptation, that I had to give it a go.Most of the novel I read avidly, especially in the second half, but be warned there are pages and pages -- CHAPTERS -- of descriptions about architecture, and the first fifty pages of the book are rather tedious. If you're an impatient reader like me look out for the main characters while you skim --Gringoire, Esmerelda, Frollo, Jehan, Phoebus, Fleur de Lys and Quasimodo -- until the story really gets going.There is a strong thread of fate, 'Anarkia' in Greek, running through the book. The anti-hero, Archdeacon Claude Frollo, is obsessed by it. He's a man of obsessions -- nothing is entered into halfheartedly for him. He's the most vividly sketched character in the book, and while he acts by turns hatefully and selfishly, he's also given a depth of humanity and complexity that makes him sympathetic. Each of the characters affect their fates in ways that only the reader can comprehend, making this a true tragedy: the downfall comes from within. Even the moments of salvation, such as when Esmerelda finds [redacted] are bitter and ironic. A story to read, and reread, obsessively (perhaps in a cloister while tearing at the buttons of one's black cassock.)
209`3`Oh, God, FINALLY!!! After MONTHS I finished this!I've read Les Miserables a couple of years ago and it was one, if not THE one, of the best classics I have ever read! So, I wanted to move on and read another famous classic by Victor Hugo, because I loved his writing style.But the dream became a nightmare... Well, not exactly. But still, it wasn't that fun to read.Some people "hate" The Silmarillion, by J.R.R. Tolkien because of the many names and places and descriptions of everything. You know what? THIS WAS WORSE! (I love Silmarillion to be honest)So many freakin' descriptions of EVERY SINGLE BUILDING around Paris. So many RANDOM people with crazy french names!I was so tired reading it, that's why it took so long.But when it got into the story, like almost half a book later, it was AMAZING.Great story, full of emotions and even action. Good characters you adore. Crazy people you hate with all your guts. Love and romance in their purest form.Also, don't get into the story with the hopes of a happy Disney movie ending. Oh, no no no. This ending is going to slowly rip your heart out of your chest and break it in pieces...No, escuse me. I want to listen to the best Disney villain son ever existed. Hellfire!
210`3`Ok, I must admit here, Disney pretty much left me with some misconceptions for some of the fairy tales (and not so fairy like this one)that all of its movies are based on, and to be honest, so far I still prefer "The little mermaid" disney version than the original one by Hans Christian Andersen (Yep, sorry to say that, my pink world inner child can't get pass the traumatic discovery that she ends up turning into sea spray and the prince doesn't even love her *sad face*). So, when I got this book I was already expecting some changes from the disney version, I was somewhat mentally prepared, but turns out, I really wasn't for what I read.Ok, I acknowledge this is well written, heck, it's Victor Hugo for christ's sake! Hence the three stars rating.But like most of the readers nowadays, maybe it's too much for the modern times, too flowery and descriptive to say the least. Maybe it's because I have attention problems, I don't know, I just can't stand long descriptions, just give me some action and story to dive in, otherwise I'll skip it (as I did with some of the description pages in this book).But well, that's the technical aspect of the book, let's talk about the actual story.We begin with Pierre Gringoire, a street poet (I don't know why, but still to this day I feel like in the movie they mix him up with Clopin). I was wrong to believe he was going to be the guiding force to the story, given the fact that we follow him the first pages until we get to the Court of miracles (and we witness his bizarre fixation with a goat...wut?). Then we move on to the characters we all "know and love"...or so I thought.Esmeralda, the kind-hearted gipsy, who is so infatuated with Captain Phoebus that she never admits his betrayal, even if he's in front of her, pointing at her as the one who attempt to murder him. Wait...what?? *My inner child starts to crumble*Srsly, I was cringing through the whole damn book for the blindness and idiocy of this bimbo!!! But, well, what else could you expect from a 15 year old? (I believe that's her age in the book)And therefore, that brings me to Captain Phoebus, who I grew to believe was this hero with integrity and ideals, and blablabla (thank you, disney, for laying the foundations of my growth upon LIES!!!). This character really upsets me so much, there's not a single redeemible quality about him, not even if he "saves her" early on from Quasimodo. He's the poster guy for machismo, a selfish womanizer who lusts over this child (pedophilia, anyone??) and once he almost gets what he wants (and gets stabbed by Frollo because of that), turns against her and throws her to the sharks. I mean, what kind of wicked asshole would laugh at the hanging of the girl he seduced like hours ago and practically worships him???I despised him, SO MUCH, even more than Frollo.Frollo, on the other hand, wasn't so much of a surprise. I even reckon to think, while reading the book, that he was even kind to Quasimodo in a good way, that gives him a compassionate side I wasn't expecting. Of course, then everything changed when the Court of miracles attacked.But even though, I think his strong believes made him act the way he acted, and his passion for Esmeralda, of course. Although he just lost it at the end.About Quasimodo himself, I can't say a lot, he was barely present, but was pretty much what I expected. Even for a deaf almost mentally challenged hunchback.And, I'm sorry but...WHAT THE HELL WAS WITH THE LOST DAUGHTER STORYLINE??? It doesn't even come to a satisfying conclusion. I was waiting for Esmeralda to realize that was her mother, but nothing, the mother just dies after hitting her head and she's executed anyway. Gosh, so depressing.So, this is what Disney did to me, build a pink unicorns and sugar clouded world for me, just to watch it crash and burn later. Not cool, disney. NOT COOL.And even though, I crawl back to that shattered world again and choose the happier versions I grew up with to feel secure. I know it's wrong, but it feels good.
211`3`Okay, I'm glad I read this book, if only to find out just how badly Disney ruined the story for the sake of their embarassing excuse for a film. (the horrendous straight-to-video sequel, which I fortunately only saw previews for, will not be spoken of at all.) Victor Hugo has a gift for the most ungodly depressing stories, but he writes very well when he's not rambling pointlessly to stretch out his page count. But I can't bring myself to give this four stars, and for one simple reason: with the exception of Quasimodo and Esmeralda, every single character in this book is an insufferable dickhead. Frollo, obviously, deserves to be fed to sharks simply for the mind-boggling levels of creepiness he manages to achieve over the course of the story. Phoebus is even more of a fratboy asshole that I'd previously thought, and the way he decides to seduce Esmeralda despite the fact that she's the Gypsy equivalent of a vestal virgin made me want to teleport into the story so I could kick him in the nuts. Frollo's younger brother Jehan is a relatively minor character, but he gets mentioned because in every single scene he appears in, he's constantly yammering away and trying to be clever and witty, the result being that he makes Jar Jar Binks seem terribly endearing in comparison. And Gringoire. I had such hope for him. He starts out promising, but then once Esmeralda gets arrested all he can worry about is the stupid goat, because I guess he thinks she's cuter than his fucking wife who saved his fucking life. When he joins Frollo to get Esmeralda out of the catherdral, he leaves the sixteen-year-old girl with Pastor Pedo McCreepy, and chooses to save the goat. The fucking goat. One final word of advice: skip the chapter entitled "A Bird's Eye View of Paris." It's thirty pages of pointless babbling about what Paris looks like from Notre Dame, and it is impossible to read all the way through without wanting to stab yourself in the eyes with the first sharp object you can reach.I know what you're saying - "Thirty pages? Pfft, that's nothing, I can get through that, I read Ulysses." First of all: you did not. Second: no, you cannot get through these thirty pages. "Mind-numbing" does not do it justice. It is pointless. Don't say I didn't warn you. 
212`4`One of my favorite things to do back when I taught Lit / English classes was to discuss the real stories of Disney movies and other adaptations of fairy tales. Kids always love getting the truth and The Hunchback of Notre Dame is another great example of an epic book whose darker parts got stripped away by Disney. I recently read ‚ÄòHow to read literature like a professor‚Äô and there was a great examination in there on the relationship between physical appearance and morality in lit as in - the witch is ugly, the evil Russian spy will have a scared face etc. Hugo‚Äôs novel was mentioned as one of the first to create a physically deformed character with a good heart. This was a reread for me during a trip to Paris where we stayed right across from Notre Dame so that definitely added a lot... and made the long / dry history of Paris, history if the cathedral, and history of France chapters a little more palatable.
213`4`One of the best classics I've ever read. Intriguing, heart-wrenching, and well explained. I started it late at night and got more than halfway before I had to go to bed, and I finished it as soon as I could the next day, it sucked me in that much. I felt like I was in Paris and I saw the characters so vividly, it hurt. My favorite was Quasimodo: his character was incredible, haunting, and so sad.
214`5`One of the greatest classics I read.. :)
215`5`Ormai ho perso il conto delle volte che ho letto e riletto questo romanzo.Meraviglioso
216`4`Overall I liked this book. It was nice to read a book that actually made me think. The characters and their struggles will stick with you, and the sad lessons that are taught can help us to be more inclusive and accepting of others. Still a good book 200 years later.
217`5`Perfection. One of the most haunting, most beautifully written books I have ever read in my life. I was always on the brink of tears... Beautiful, majestic book in every sense of the word.
218`4`Picked this up for a read-along with the book by Victor Hugo, thinking it was a bande dessin√©e adaptation of the novel and was very surprised to find out it's only an illustrated edition of the French original, split in two volumes (this is the first and covers the first half of the novel). Not that I'm disappointed, to be clear, but seeing Lacombe has such an unique art style, I find myself wishing it had been a proper graphic novel adaptation. The art is just so lovely!
219`4`Poor, tragic Quasimodo. For the third book of my insomnia series (behind War and Peace, Don Quixote) I decided to read a story I was familiar with through the films. Quasimodo‚Äôs love for the gypsy Esmerelda is there, but Captain Phoebus‚Äô love for her is of a different variety and he is certainly no hero (would Phoebus be the next sexual predator outed in this day and time?) And there is certainly no happy ever after for Esmerelda at the end (of a rope).On a positive note, the lengthy descriptions of Paris and architecture throughout the book helped cure my insomnia on those nights. I also found some great quotes: ‚ÄúTime is a devourer; man, more so.‚Äù and when Esmerelda is ignoring him for Phoebus, Quasimodo says, ‚ÄúDamnation! That is what one should be like! ‚ÄòTis only necessary to be handsome on the outside!‚Äù So, let the myriad bells of Notre Dame, with their little copper tongues, peal loud and long. Ring on, Quasimodo, ring on.
220`3`Popsugar 2018-A book where you‚Äôve already seen the movie.
221`3`Por momentos es absolutamente m√°gico, me ha transportado al Par√≠s de aquella √©poca, a querer caminarla, a so√±ar con haberla conocido. A ella y a sus personajes!!! Tiene algunos cap√≠tulos que, seg√∫n mis intereses, abundan en descripciones sobre arquitectura. La historia se sigue sin esos cap√≠tulos, pero soy incapaz de salt√°rmelos. Ahora, a atacar el segundo tomo!!!!! Y a descubrir ese desenlace!
222`2`Premetto che la mia unica esperienza con Il gobbo di Notre-Dame - oltre al film della Disney - si rif√† al musical di Cocciante. Ma qui le cose sono un po' diverse: non c'√® un personaggio che si salva. Forse la sola Esmeralda, che per√≤ fa una fine tremenda. Febo si diverte con tutte le donne che trova; Frollo √® l√¨ che combatte i suoi ormoni a mille e perde in maniera catastrofica; Quasimodo deve vedersela con un amore non corrisposto.Rispetto al musical, dove c'erano tanti colori, √® un mondo cupo e sporco, dove la gente muore e a nessuno importa nulla. Leggendo, la differenzia si √® notata parecchio. 
223`5`Pretty much what I expected after seeing the black and white 1930's movie on TV many many years ago but the book is different in that the focus isn't solely on Quasimodo and his relationships. Similar to Moby Dick, there is a lot of background given about the subject and how history affects the events in the story. This Victor Hugo book is much easier to read than Moby Dick.
224`4`RTC. Possibly 4.5. I have to think about it but it was definitely a great surprise and something that didn‚Äôt read like a classic (didn‚Äôt drag like they often do... sorry for saying that, not meant to be offensive).
225`2`Rather incredible story, but the style is all, very impressive and to a great extent compelling.  Characters:  - Frollo: kind of Faust (even explicit link) - Quasimodo: the human monster - Esmeralda: intriguing, strong woman, but not well worked out character - Gringoire: opportunist, too wordy Especially the end is very implausible. Clearly written very fast, but nevertheless a "tour de force"
226`5`Read in one day. Loved. Tis about fate. Plus physicality as both imprisonment and embodiment. I adored tragic Esmeralda. And have gotta emigrate to Gothic Paris. *hails time machine*
227`4`Read this to help my son with his book report. Surprisingly it was really pretty good.
228`1`Reading The Hunchback of Norte-Dame was a nightmare for me. I don't mind trudging through a certain degree of detail, but The Hunchback contained well beyond a reasonable amount of description.The book starts out with a play no one is watching. We return to what is going on with the play again and again which distracts from the excitement of the crowd. We are then provided with an entire chapter describing Notre-Dame. Quickly followed by a longer chapter about Paris that doesn't pertain to the story any further than its being the setting. A few more chapters of story and then another description only chapter, this time about architecture and other forms of art. The description is overkill and is so dull and tiring I could barely force myself to finish the book.Victor Hugo addressed the reader many times, like many writers of the time did. This "breaking the fourth wall" is something I personally dislike. It reminds me that I am reading a story, thus pulling me out of totally submersion. Or at least it would have if I had been able to keep my eyes open longer than a few pages at a time. At one point, Hugo writes "Our reader must excuse us" before taking us on another descriptive tangent.I'm sorry, Mr. Hugo, but you're not excused. Every once in a while, when he focused on the actual plot, the book was interesting. Unfortunately a large majority of the book was a cross between a guide book and a text book. Why is The Hunchback of Notre-Dame a classic? Only because it's old? I don't see the appeal.
229`3`Really liked the writing, but the beginning took a while to get through and actually get started on the story. Wanted to dnf it several times. Still enjoyed it though overall
230`5`Recensione dal blog EC_Shivers' https://ecshivers.com/2017/03/28/notr...Hugo vi far√† da guida nella Parigi del tardo Medioevo, per raccontarvi il contesto storico e i magnifici personaggi, che prendono vita sotto la sua penna: il poeta girovago e sognatore Gringoire, la giovane e bella gitana Esmeralda, che ama l‚Äôaffascinante ufficiale Phoebus, e che √® segretamente amata dall‚Äôanima nera del romanzo, Frollo, l‚Äôarcidiacono della cattedrale. Nella maestosa Notre-Dame, insieme a Frollo, vive anche Quasimodo, lo storpio campanaro, che consapevole della sua terribile bruttezza, accetta con sottomissione di vivere alle dipendenze dell‚Äôarcidiacono, segregato tra i rosoni, le guglie ed i gargoyle di pietra della chiesa, lontano da una societ√† che lo disprezzerebbe.Sullo sfondo di una Parigi in cui il divario sociale tra poveri e ricchi non potrebbe essere pi√π netto, incontreremo i bassifondi della Corte dei Miracoli, dove vivono i reietti, gli emarginati e gli zingari come Esmeralda, ma anche lo sfarzo di case potenti, dove ci√≤ che accade all‚Äôesterno non ha nessuna importanza. Osservando quindi il romanzo da un punto di vista sociale, si nota che in fondo √® cambiato ben poco dall‚Äôepoca che Hugo ci descrive: le distanze sociali sono sempre evidenti e i soprusi nei confronti degli indifesi sono all‚Äôordine del giorno. La grande maestria di Hugo non si manifesta quindi solo nel creare una storia epica, capace di divertire e commuovere in modo profondo, ma anche nella capacit√† di far riflettere ancora oggi su temi fondamentali come giustizia ed uguaglianza.
231`5`Rese√±a original en: http://vocesdeloslibros.blogspot.com....Hace tiempo que le√≠ Los Miserables y desde entonces quise leer m√°s cosas de Victor Hugo. Nuestra Se√±ora de Paris est√° en mi lista de pendientes desde hace tiempo pero quise esperar a que la preciosa edici√≥n de Edelvives, ilustrada por el artista franc√©s Benjamin Lacombe se publicara completa, pues est√° dividida en dos tomos. Lo que no tuve en cuenta en un principio fue el coste de la obra completa. Pero ya os digo que merece completamente la pena. Como esta es la edici√≥n que yo le√≠, rese√±ar√© los dos vol√∫menes.Antes de nada, me veo en la obligaci√≥n de advertir a aquellos que pretend√°is leer este libro, que el principal protagonista es Notre Dame, o Nuestra Se√±ora, como ser√≠a el nombre de la catedral traducido. En la √©poca en que Victor Hugo escribi√≥ este libro, la catedral se encontraba muy deteriorada y fueron muchos los que temieron por su futuro, pues ya entonces muchos otros edificios emblem√°ticos hab√≠an desaparecido, bien v√≠ctimas del tiempo, la revoluci√≥n o el progreso. De este modo, el autor escribi√≥ una novela de amores desdichados ambientada en el Par√≠s medieval.En este primer tomo, nos encontramos con largas descripciones de los monumentos de Par√≠s, aquellos que ya pasados de moda corr√≠an el riesgo de ser demolidos o ‚Äúrestaurados‚Äù y aquellos que ya se hab√≠an perdido. Se hace muy patente la gran preocupaci√≥n que ten√≠a el autor por preservar el arte g√≥tico en la capital francesa, y no son pocas las cr√≠ticas tanto a monarcas como a arquitectos y artistas. Estas descripciones est√°n intercaladas con el desarrollo de la historia de nuestros otros protagonistas cuyas aventuras siempre tienen lugar cerca de la catedral.Otra cosa que tambi√©n critica el autor con mucha frecuencia es el misticismo y la fr√°gil moral de la gente de aquella √©poca. Quasimodo es odiado por todos los parisienses, m√°s por su fealdad que por otra cosa, pero tambi√©n por ser el campanero de Nuestra Se√±ora y despertarlos por las noches. Sin embargo el autor deja patente la tristeza que invadi√≥ Par√≠s cuando el campanero desapareci√≥ y dej√≥ un vacio en la catedral.La edici√≥n de Edelvives es una aut√©ntica preciosidad, llena de peque√±os detalles que hacen del libro una peque√±a joya. Benjamin Lacombe ha llenado el libro de peque√±os dibujos a grandes ilustraciones. He tardado m√°s tiempo en contemplar todos los detalles que en leer el libro.Un detalle que me ha encantado es encontrar al final de cada volumen una peque√±a biograf√≠a del autor, el ilustrador y el traductor. 
232`5`Review in the least amount of words: Homo homini monstrum*If I were to rate this book based on how good it is, I'd give it one star. I say 'good', as in it ends with rainbows and sunshine and happy characters. But it doesn't. It's probably the cruelest, most grotesque book I've ever read. And I'm not rating it based on how it should've ended. I'm rating it based on the hours I spent reading into the night, telling myself this next chapter would be the last and then going back on my promise. The outcome of the story? I hated it. Hate it with all my soul. The story itself?I loved it.There's just a few things I want to point out: this book is in no way like the Disney Hunchback. Of course Disney could never bring itself to make a dramatic ending any more than it could bring itself to quit making movies altogether. But I'll treat the two versions, the book and the movie, as two seperate stories, because recently The Hunchback of Notre-Dame has become one of my favorite Disney films. Admittedly now I can never picture in my mind the Disney 'Quasi', Esmeralda, and Pheobus the same way I used to-with admiration and compassion-or without remembering their much darker novel counterparts. But I'm not gonna make comparisons in this review.Hugo is one of those authors that gives us endless descriptions of the scenery, as if they matter, but unlike C.S Lewis I enjoyed reading them (I'll just admit that I did skip a few chapters because I wanted to get back to the story). One of the few of these sort of chapters I did read was Notre-Dame: you could plainly see how opposed Hugo was to what man has done this monstrous structure, defaced it, amputated its spire, knocked over its statues, rendered its interior unrecognizable from the time setting of this story. This I enjoyed reading. Hugo was more than a historian; he was a passionate rebel. He perfectly captures the background of the fifteenth-century, and makes a point of letting the reader know how different society was back then. In the Disney movie, Frollo tells Quasimodo that the world is cruel and evil outside of Notre-Dame, but Esmeralda teaches him that really it isn't, and that gypsies are kind people. But in the book it is evident right away that the people of Paris are every bit as cruel and heartless as the Disney Frollo made them out to be. While Quasimodo is being punished at the pillory not a single heart is moved, except for that of the fair Esmeralda. The Truands, or the beggars, are likewise heartless; Clopin Trouillefou, king of the Truands, enjoys nothing less than slitting throats and hangings. Their superstitions and strong religious beliefs, though got on my nerves at times, also made the medieval folk seem more sinister to me; the mad preist, the deranged recluse; such characters deepened the sense of devilry in the story.Perhaps the most heart-rending moment for me, though, was Esmeralda crying 'No! No! I don't want to die!' before being executed. Though she is not my favorite heroine in literature, I could blame her naivity on her age; she's only a little girl. And she was hated for crimes she did not commit or didn't even exist, as were alot of people of that time; by being beautiful, a preist falls in love with her and blames her for his damnation; by teaching a goat tricks, she is accused of witchcraft; by being a gypsy, the recluse wants to see her hanged, not knowing that the girl is actually the daughter she has been mourning fifteen years for. (This concept only strengthened my despair for Esmeralda; she finally found her mother, only to watch her die a few hours later and be hanged herself). Near the end of the story I was coming up with a million ways to give it a happy ending, or atleast to save Esmeralda, some of them impossible. My earliest solution was if Quasimodo had not been deaf, he would've known that the Truands had come to rescue the gypsy girl and she would've been saved. But then, if he hadn't been deaf he wouldn't have gotten such a brutal punishment at court at the beginning of the book, and Esmeralda wouldn't have needed to show him pity. Thus, he wouldn't have saved her.Quasimodo is another interesting character in the story; alot uglier than the cartoon Quasi, described more like an animal than a man, and impassive about most of the things that went on around him. He does not yearn to leave Notre-Dame. Rather he despises humanity that despises him, and he keeps to the cathedral and its bells; he was the very soul of it, as Hugo says. Although he is not the main character of the book, he is an example of *man's inhumanity to man; only by being handicapped, he is looked upon by society as a monstor. The chapter entitled Immanis Pecoris Custos Immanior Ipse was one of my favorites. Hugo did it wonderfully. There are some authors who think they can write, authors that can write, and authors whom it is impossible not to recognize by their style of elaborate and excellent writing. Victor Hugo is strictly in the latter form.Some of my other favorite chapters:-The Story of a Cake-Concerning the Danger of Confiding One's Secret to a Goat-Deaf-Earthenware and Crystal-The Little Shoe
233`5`Review title: "This will kill that"Forget the movies, either the classic black and white oldies or the Disney cartoon (what could they possibly have been thinking?). Literally forget them, just as the scriptwriter of those movies must have hoped that readers of the book would do, if indeed any of those watching the movies had ever read the book at all. The book is vastly different, at once darker and brighter, full of vibrant life and bottomless darkness--and it has little to do with the hunchback of the wrongly titled English translations. Hugo hated that title because it obscured the true central character of the book identified in his original French title: the cathedral of Notre Dame. Inserted in the middle of Hugo's classic are two chapters left out of the original English translations but upon which the book and the plot of human history turns. When a book makes such an impression on me that I make such astounding claims, it must be a classic. The translator's preface to this edition says the omitted chapters were not thought central to the plot; I wonder rather if they were really too central to an incendiary truth to be left in a "mere" novel. While it is only anecdotal and based on a sample size of one, I checked the mid 20th century Dodd, Mead edition at my local library and indeed, those two chapters were omitted with no ellipsis or other typographical signal of the gap. Notre Dame is organized into books and chapters, and in my edition Book V consists of the two omitted chapters. The bowdlerized library edition just completely ignores the existence of these chapters and moves up the chapters which make up Book VI in my edition and calls them Book V, with the result that it ends at Book X while my edition has a Book XI! Before we consider how a cathedral can be a character and what was in those missing chapters that is so central to human history, first a short recap of the story. Warning: if you only know the distorted plots of the movie adaptations, there will be spoilers. And while this covers the key plot points, the richness of the plot, characters, dialogue, and settings are so much greater than my pedestrian summary that the book will withstand a close reading even once you know the plot. The book is simply overwhelming. Priest Claude Frollo is the Archdeacon of Notre Dame, while raising his orphaned young brother Jehan, rescuing the abandoned infant hunchback Quasimodo (literally "half-made") from a pauper's death, and training him to care for the bells of the cathedral. When the gorgeous but innocent gypsy street entertainer Esmeralda is rescued by dashing calvary captain Phoebus from a kidnapping by a pair of mysterious men, Quasimodo is accused of the crime and sent to the pillory. Esmeralda is the only one who shows him mercy, melting the deaf and unloved man's heart, while she is hopelessly devoted to her idolized Phoebus. In the meantime, returning to her streetwise gang of tramps, she wins the love of a third man, the impoverished poet Pierre Gringoire who has stumbled into the gang's territory, when she saves him from a lynching death by casually agreeing to marry him (then rejecting him as a lover)! The third man was Frollo, whose terrifying lust had led him to attempt to capture the girl by force, and would drive him to despair, desperation, and death. Frollo insinuates himself into the relationship between Esmeralda and Phoebus, giving Phoebus the rent for the cheap room where he will meet the girl, in exchange for permission to hide in a closet and watch Phoebus and Esmeralda's lovemaking. Esmeralda expresses her love and gratitude for her rescuer, who considers her just another one night stand, and when she has disrobed and is coming to him on the bed, Frollo's lust and jealousy drive him into a blind rage, he bursts out of the closet, stabs the soldier, and disappears from the room leaving Esmeralda to be arrested for the attempted murder. Disney cartoon? What could they possibly have been thinking?Visiting Esmeralda in prison, the now demented Frollo expresses his undying lust and offers to help her escape in exchange for giving herself to him. She prefers the gallows instead, but when taken in chains to the cathedral to satisfy the sentence of penance before hanging, Quasimodo uses his brutish strength to free her from her captors and take her into the church with his haunting chant of "Sanctuary!" Esmeralda's temporary reprieve is threatened by a Parliamentary order to invade the sanctuary of the cathedral, but Pierre, the forgotten husband in their unconsummated marriage, organizes the street gang into a crude army to attack the cathedral and free their dancing queen. But after partnering with Frollo to escort her to freedom, Pierre slips away, leaving Esmeralda alone with the evil Frollo in a truly terrifying scene. Despite Phoebus's lack of love and respect for her (he is engaged and by book's end is married into society), she remains true to him and rejects the mad Frollo yet again. In retaliation, Frollo brings the police and executioner to her, leaving her to hang while he watches from the towers of Notre Dame, where Quasimodo, finally realizing his master for the wretch he has become, pushes Frollo to his death and disappears. OK, so I promised short, but overshot my target, and even then I keep remembering key events and characters I have left out. This is a fully populated world whose characters interact and relate in many ways. Pay attention to the details and you will be rewarded. One of the details, as we return to the chapters left out of the earlier English translations, is the nature of Frollo's character. As the Archdeacon of Notre Dame he is (at the start at least) a pious priest, a caring mentor and father figure for Jehan and Quasimodo, and a well known and visible leader in the political, social and religious life of Paris. In the missing chapters we see him also as a serious thinker and philosopher/scientist, and concerned caretaker of the character and architecture of Notre Dame. He is so well respected in those fields that he receives a nighttime visit from King Louis in disguise accompanied by his court physician Coictier and seeking medical advice. The discussion turns into a debate on ancient wisdom and texts, when Frollo takes the unexpected turn into the architectural wonders of the Egyptian pyramids, towers of Babylon, and Solomon's temple. Frollo, passionately concluding his case, says "But, before all, I would have you read the letters of the marble alphabet, the leaves of the granite book." The king, puzzled, asks: "Where are your books? " to bring Frollo back to the sources of wisdom: "Here is one," said the Archdeacon.And, throwing open the window of his cell, he pointed with his finger to the immense church of Notre Dame, which, with the black outline of its towers cut on a starlit sky, its stone sides and monstrous body, seemed a double-headed sphinx seated in the middle of the city. The Archdeacon for a while considered the gigantic edifice, then, stretching with a sigh his right hand toward the printed book that lay open on the table, while his left hand pointed at Notre Dame, he said, "Alas! This will kill that!" Coictier, who had eagerly approached the book, could not help crying : "Why, what is so frightening about this? 'Glossa in epistolus' D. Pauli, Norimberge, Antonius Roburger, 1474? It is not new. It is a book of Pierre Lombard, the master of sentences. Is it because it is printed?" "You have said it," rejoined Claude [Frollo], who seemed absorbed in deep meditation and stood erect, with his forefinger bent on the folio from the famed Nuremberg presses. Then he added these words: "Alas, alas! The smallest things are the death of the greatest. . . . The book will kill the building!" (p. 160-161) At this point the physician turns to the king, with whom he has been disagreeing throughout the conversation to this point and says "He is mad." The king "this time replied, 'I think so.'"  Far from mad, Hugo through Frollo has just brought the central character of the novel into sharp, dark focus, a black hole against the starry sky, then exploded his incendiary idea in the face of religion, science, and the king himself (and yes, Frollo had already recognized the king despite his disguise), ruler by divine right and presence of God himself, whose voice is the authority in all subjects. The idea is so important and so powerful that Hugo devotes the next 12 pages to expanding on it in a chapter entitled "This Will Kill That." Architecture, building in wood and stone, was the first way man expressed his thoughts and beliefs. It was man's first alphabet, first language. "In truth, from the creation of things to the fifteenth century of the Christian era, architecture was the great book of humanity, the principal expression of the human being in his various states of development, whether as force or as intelligence. . . . Solomon's Temple, for instance, was not merely a part of a holy book but the book itself." (p. 162, 163)Then  In the fifteenth century, everything changed. Human thought discovered a means of perpetuating itself in a more lasting and resistant form than architecture. It was simpler and easier as well. Architecture was dethroned. . . . In the printed form the mind is more imperishable than ever: it is volatile, not to be grasped or destroyed. It mingles with the air. In the days of architecture it had grown to a mountain and powerfully weighed on a century and a place. Now, it has become a flock of birds, scattered on the four winds and at once filling every point of the air and space. (p. 168) So while Hugo has written a novel dominated by the massive grandeur of the cathedral of Our Lady, he has also written a novel teeming with human minds fueled by the printed word, sacred books and law books, profound and profane, and these humans swirl through and around the cathedral in lives, minds, and souls powered by the book. Perhaps it is only right that Hollywood and the English translators have abandoned the cathedral as the central character of Hugo's classic, because the characters have in fact abandoned the cathedral first! I was taken aback and taken unawares by Hugo's insight. It forced me to put the book down after those two chapters to absorb what I had just read, then to flip back through to make sure that I understood what he said, and could start to think about what it meant. In the last 18 months I have stood in the ruined stones of 7th century Celtic churches and worshipped amidst the majesty of Westminster Abby and St Paul's cathedral. I have felt in awe of both and Hugo has helped me understand now more of the mystery of those stones. They are a language of a people reaching out to worship an infinite God whom they can neither contain within those walls nor speak to him so clearly outside them. But I have also seen the Lindesfarne Gospels and the Book of Kells, the alphabet on paper that became the raw material for the printing press that made spiritual matters personal, boundless, ethereal, and eternal, and made the presence of that God both universal and personal. Now, we could know and talk to this God not just within the walls of the cathedral but outdoors and everywhere, as Hugo had said "at once filling every point of the air and space"! But just as our minds were freed from the constraints of the cathedral for worship, they were also given liberty to study all things, and Frollo would learn, much like Dr. Faust whom he resembles in those key chapters, that the mind can become consumed by a study of liberty and learning that ends in lust. So there it is: Notre Dame de Paris. At the end of the book it stands, empty and battered, but still standing, at the center just as it always had been. All of the human characters that we got to know in Hugo's masterful words are gone. Yet the cathedral stands even today. What does the language of its architecture still tell us?
234`2`Short story so super quick read. Don't expect the happy go lucky Disney version of it though.
235`5`Sin lugar a dudas V√≠ctor Hugo fue un excelente escritor. Aqu√≠, al igual que en Los Miserables, puede verse lo pulido de su pluma y la influencia de la poes√≠a en su prosa. Es una obra magistral, hermosa, que se lee con ansia devoradora a flor de piel. Me encantaron los cap√≠tulos dedicados a la arquitectura de la Edad Media y a la p√©rdida de esta por la invenci√≥n de la imprenta. En estas dos obras, puede verse la fascinaci√≥n que Hugo sent√≠a por este periodo.La mayor expresi√≥n de romanticismo se vive en la declaraci√≥n final que hace Frollo a Esmeralda; dejando de lado lo oscuro del personaje y de sus sentimientos, el discurso me conmovi√≥ y me pareci√≥ muy fuerte. El final fue totalmente sorpresivo. Creo que ning√∫n lector se lo esperar√≠a, mucho menos si vio la pel√≠cula de Disney cuya adaptaci√≥n es poco fiel al libro. Es un novela perfecta y mucho m√°s en esta versi√≥n ilustrada por un grande como Benjamin Lacombe, todo un deleite para los sentidos. 
236`3`So I did read this for a long time because I had to writte my final exams and the beginning of the book was really hard to enjoy. Of course this book isn't like the Disney movie but that isn't bad at all.The story line is well written and I loved the connactions between the different characters ;) the only thing that wasn't enjoyable was that Monsieur Hugo attackted the reader with unneccessary informations :(But all in all it is a great novel.3.5/5
237`null`So. Damned. Boring. Life is too short to read this book. I gave it 23% before throwing in the towel.
238`5`Some books are disappointing because they deliver exactly what you would expect from them; and some are disappointing for being entirely different from what you had antecipated; ‚ÄòNotre-Dame de Paris‚Äô, with a story and characters so known and referenced across pop-culture (especially because of the extraodinary Disney film) that hardly anyone will have absolutely no knowledge of the story‚Äôs most basic outlines, is an amazing achievement because, though barely resemblant of it‚Äôs adaptations, manages to immerse the reader in such an intricate web of powerful, thought-provoking drama that the characters you thought you already knew become as fresh and exciting as when you first knew them.This is a book I struggled with in it‚Äôs first half precisely because it was so radically different from what I thought it would be: the pace was painfully slow at first; the main characters are only introduced well into the novel, and only generically do they resemble the characters I knew from the adaptations; there are many side characters and plot-threads that I wasn‚Äôt so invested in as in the characters I already knew. And yet Hugo‚Äôs writting is so vivid in it‚Äôs description of people, of their appearance and their feelings, of the architecture of a medieval Paris, so full of graceful wit, of pierceful critique, of intense emotion, and has such a seductive quality over the reader that I was constantly engaged, if somewhat aprehensive. But Victor Hugo is an author that is always rewarding of his reader‚Äôs perseverance, and without realizing it I was already completely under the novel‚Äôs charm.This is perhaps Hugo‚Äôs most thought-provoking work, and one of the reasons it is so lies precisely in the nature of it‚Äôs characters. In ‚ÄòLes Miser√°bles‚Äô there is a line between the purity of the main characters (Jean Valjean, Cosette, Marius) and the wickedness of their adversaries (Javert, Th√©nardier) that allows the reader to distinguish good from evil. In ‚ÄòL¬¥Homme Qui Rit‚Äô much the same happens, with Gwynplaine and Dea as the virtuous protagonists against the suffocating forces of medieval monarchy. Much different is the case of ‚ÄòNotre-Dame de Paris‚Äô (written many years before these other works); you can‚Äôt label any of it‚Äôs main characters as being good or evil because they share the same drive: love; and it is that love which makes this intricate drama so fascinating; none of the characters are right or act in a right way, and yet the reader is compelled to like them and to care for them. Claude Frollo‚Äôs love of Esmeralda is of such intensity that leads him to commit hateful atrocities to conquer her; Frollo is indeed a dangerous stalker, yet the gypsy‚Äôs no less hateful rejection of him (‚ÄúYou are ugly! You are old!‚Äù) makes the reader see him with pitiful eyes. Esmeralda is also trapped in her love for the shallow, beautiful and seductive Captain Phoebus, who, despite his upcoming marriage, has no lack of lovers. The gypsy‚Äôs adoration of him is due to nothing more than his physical beauty, and although her dedication to him is pure, it is also revealing of her superficiality. Quasimodo, the horribly deformed proteg√© of Claude and bell-ringer in the cathedral of Notre-Dame, sentenced to public torture and humiliation after trying to kidnap Esmeralda under Frollo‚Äôs command, falls in love with the gypsy after her touching act of compassion to him (she steps up to give him water after his desperate cries of pain). The hunchback then becomes her unflinching protector, and his blind dedication to her will be their undoing in the face of the ensuing misunderstandings brought about by Claude.In other novels by Victor Hugo, particularly the ones mentioned above, love is showcased as a powerful force for redemption and healing, through which one can achieve the kind of virtuous purity that Hugo thought to be the highest form of Humanity. Such pure love is not what he‚Äôs interested in exploring here; this is a story of dangerously intense, obsessive love, a kind of exacerbated passion that awakes some of the darkest impulses of the spirit, none of which being less destructive than jealousy. In fact, I would go so far as to claim jealousy as the central theme of the book. It is Claude‚Äôs jealousy that obscures the love in his heart, that makes him quit his efforts to correct his strayed brother, that leads him to forget his affection for Quasimodo that first made him adopt him, that brings him away from the scientific studies which constituted his passion, that compells him to commit nefarious criminal acts. And it is such jealously, such desire to possess Esmeralda, and to be the only one to do so, that makes him seek her death in the face of her rejection (‚ÄúShe shall have no one.‚Äù) and that ultimately seals the tragedy.In trying to figure out Hugo‚Äôs ultimate message in this novel, I started to wonder what character he felt more sympathy towards. He certainly has fun with Gringoire and Jehan Frollo, the first being a subjugated poet whose main concern becomes avoiding the gallows and saving Djali, Esmeralda‚Äôs goat, and the latter being the rebellious and irreverent young brother of Claude. The author also has a kind of solidarity for the sadistic Clopin, the king of the gypsies, whose cruelty only equals that of his people‚Äôs pursuers. Hugo has a clear dislike of Phoebus, of that I have no doubt. I think Hugo sees Esmeralda as potentially virtuous, though mislead by worldly passions; she is strong, pure and compassionate, yet rendered weak by her love of the Captain and feral in her rejection of Frollo; in fact, in one of the books final and most poignant moments, she rejects a long lost, pure love in favor of a superficial passion. With all this considered, I‚Äôm still unsure about whether Hugo felt more sympathy for Frollo or for Quasimodo. It‚Äôs clear that he had a certain affection for Frollo and that, despite his many flaws, he wanted the reader to feel for the desperation of his downfall. Yet I suppose that, had he been given the chance to meet one of them in person, he would have chosen Quasimodo. Hugo was, above all things, a humanist, concerned with giving a voice to the ones who couldn‚Äôt express themselves. Most of the characters thoughout his works are the poor, the ill, the deformed, prisoners, rioters, thieves, protitutes. I think he would have welcomed Quasimodo as he would welcome the dearest of his old friends. And, indeed, Quasimodo is the purest of the novel‚Äôs characters, and provides the work‚Äôs most touching moments (the ending, in particular).Another component of Hugo‚Äôs novels, and one that tends to discourage most readers, is his long description of architecture, it‚Äôs forms,it‚Äôs history and it‚Äôs meanings. Hugo‚Äôs writting always has a didactic side, and in the case of ‚ÄòNotre-Dame de Paris‚Äô his goal was to deliver a description of a medieval Paris that would at the same time provide an immersive atmosphere and alert readers to the importance of the preservation of architectural art. In both Hugo is spectacularly successful. The architecture surrounding the narrative‚Äôs events, and the cathedral of Notre-Dame in particular, is so vivid that it becomes a character in it‚Äôs own right. And because it excells at marrying an incredibly layered narrative filled with complex characters with awareness-raising meditation on the art of architecture, this extraordinary novel becomes much more than the sum of it‚Äôs parts, and is undoubtedly one of Hugo‚Äôs finest works.Certainly one of the best historical novels ever written, with seriously thought-provoking material and one of Hugo‚Äôs most complex and layered narratives, ‚ÄòNotre-Dame de Paris‚Äô is an unmissable masterpiece.
239`5`Someone else review it almost as perfectly as you could have. He'd seen the Disney adaptation, and decided that Disney did what Disney does, and cut out a lot of important details. Fortunately I read the book first, and couldn't bear the Disney version, partially cause I was tipsy at the time.The only part of the book that was extremely difficult to make it through was the 30 page description of Paris. I took about 2 weeks to get through those, and flew through the rest. I read the title of the last chapter ("The Marriage of Qausi Modo") and thought that I had ruined the book. But I read it, and I actually enjoyed the ending better. My favorite novel.Also, you can avoid Toilers of the Sea by Hugo. There's about 200 pages in that book that I wouldn't have read, save the fact I'm a huge Hugo fan. 
240`5`Such a great story! I can't believe it took me this long to discover this book. This is my first Victor Hugo attempt and I really enjoyed it.It may be detail heavy on certain things, may ramble and go into seemingly different directions, and may go overboard on certain descriptors: but it adds character to the story and gives the characters more dimension.The Gypsy girl trying to discover her past, the obsessed priest who secretly delves into witchcraft and alchemy, and the outcast Hunchback (who oddly enough does not play a major role in the story). All the characters in my opinion are well developed and have depth.What really got me was the human element of the characters and how easily I was sucked into the storytelling. Top notch storytelling in my opinion. Thanks!
241`5`Talk about being seduced by a classic. I was really not enjoying this book at first, but slowly it grew on me. Notre-Dame de Paris, or "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame" only becomes exciting in the last third of the book or so, but the first few hundred pages are a long, slow build-up that demands your patience and attention, and gradually you will realize what a masterful writer Victor Hugo was. The main character is not Quasimodo, nor is it Esmeralda, the beautiful gypsy dancer: it is the cathedral of Notre-Dame, which at the time Hugo wrote this novel was considered something of a medieval eyesore by the citizens of Paris. Hugo's book is part grand historical epic in the tradition of Sir Walter Scott, whom he admired, and part plea to his contemporaries to preserve the great architectural masterpieces of Paris.But you don't need that background to be sucked into the story. We are given a relatively modest cast of characters (there are probably a few dozen named characters, but less than a dozen have really important roles) and a few main plot threads which Hugo skillfully couples together. At the heart of the story is a priest, Dom Claude Frollo, whose passion is ignited when he first sees Esmeralda, a gypsy dancer, and he becomes so obsessed with her that he sends his minion, Quasimodo, a deaf and deformed hunchback whom he took in as a foundling, to abduct her. Quasimodo is foiled by Captain Phoebus of the King's Guard, who thus becomes a shining knight in Esmeralda's eyes. She is so taken with the handsome, dashing captain that even though he betrays and neglects her again and again throughout the novel, she remains hopelessly smitten with him to the end.Esmeralda is by turns kind and sweet and shallow and foolish; unlike some of the film versions, she's actually a young maiden of sixteen in the book. Quasimodo is hated and feared by the citizenry, which has turned him into a bitter misanthrope himself, but Esmeralda's kindness seduces him, too. However, this is no Beauty and the Beast. The entire novel is a story of misplaced and mixed loyalties, betrayals, ironies, and fatal misunderstandings. Besides commenting on history and architecture, Hugo also makes some sharp points about human cruelty and injustice, barbaric punishments, and the death penalty. He uses a surprising amount of humor, especially in the character of Pierre Gringoire, the poet-turned-Truand and Esmeralda's erstwhile husband of the broken crock. Captain Phoebus is also something of a comic figure, though I disliked him so much I never found him very funny, but the most comical figure of all is Louis XI, a king for whom Hugo paints a most unflattering portrait, even though he only appears personally in one chapter to set in motion the fatal events of the climax.I can't do this book justice in such a short review, but suffice it to say that I loved it, and that it is well worth wading through Hugo's occasional long expository passages (entire chapters about medieval architecture and long dialogs about taxes and speeches that go on for pages!) and seemingly unconnected subplots that go off on tangents. It all fits together in the end and is a great reward for the patient reader, who will be swept away by this powerful, passionate, sometimes grotesque and tragic novel. This was one of my biggest surprises of the year in my recent resolution to read more classics: I think The Hunchback of Notre-Dame has become one of my favorites. I didn't expect to love it like I love some British literature, but Victor Hugo is now rivaling Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, and Anthony Trollope for my literary affections.A long, slow read but easily a 5-star one. Do not settle for a movie version - they all suck compared to the book.
242`4`Tengo muchas ganas de leer el segundo volumen.
243`5`The Hunchback of Notre Dame is exquisite, both the novel and the character. I found myself giving my heart away to him over and over again‚Äîand wanting to slap that silly little gypsy, Esmerelda, every time she moaned over her equally foolish Captain Phoebus. Only Quasimodo‚Äôs agape love for her restrained me. Hugo takes the reader down more than a few side streets of medieval Paris. Some reviewers here on GRs have remarked on these sections of text which do not seem to further the plot and as a result, given up on this truly GREAT novel. Yes, for readers unused to such things, this can seem tedious, but whatever you have to do‚Äîeven if you skip these parts (and come back and read them later)‚Äîpress on. Some hold that the author was in need of a good editor, but that presumes readers can only bear with the most refined of pieces of writing, which instead might be a matter of taste, effort, and/or education. When we finished, my dear husband thanked me for suggesting this book. It has a very satisfying, if bittersweet ending. Neither of us have seen the Disney movie and now we will be sure we never do see it. It can in no way compare to the book; nor can the actual story be adapted for children.Read this! Or better yet, if you can, get the audio version. Frederick Davidson‚Äôs rendering of it brings the story ALIVE! Probably it would only be 5 without his dramatization, but with it, fully 10+ stars. You can see the different characters as he does the voices so perfectly!December 9, 2018: In one sense, The Hunchback of Notre Dame would not be nearly so enjoyable were it not for Frederick Davidson's humorous rendering. Last evening he had us laughing out loud at Hugo's conversations of the French peasant women. No doubt they are clever read silently also, but books written in the author's day were meant to be read aloud and Davidson is a pro. We are over 1/2 way through and sad at the thought of the book ending, except this is a book worth re-listening to. There is so much going on; the side plots are rich in detail to any connoisseur of Medieval folklore.  Dear husband and I are again listening to an audio book in the evenings. As well as we think we know this story, neither of us has ever read it. So far, I would say, this is a good candidate for audio given its density. Downloaded a cheap copy of all Hugo's works so I could go back and reread sections and/or follow along, but never thought about the variety of numerous translations. Alas, the two translations do not match.
244`4`The Notre dame or The Hunchback was the first book that I bought as a kid. I wanted to relive that experience and decided to try the original novel.Victor Hugo shows his love for the architecture of Paris and the Notre Dame. He explains in detail how the town worked and looked like, in this specific time frame. I, for example, learned about ‚Äòthe walls of paris‚Äô and why they were built.I would definitely recommend this book if you like to learn more about the culture and architecture of Paris.But I wasn‚Äôt prepared for the real story..This book starts slow and ends far too fast. So prepare yourself for a dark romantic story revolving around the most famous church in Paris.‚ÄúA one-eyed man is much more incomplete than a blind man, for he knows what it is that's lacking.‚Äù
245`null`The book The Hunchback of Notre Dame by Victor Hugo was a great book! I was there throughout the entire story. I loved the beginning, I loved the middle, and I loved the end. This is actually a book I listened to, and it felt like I was really there. I could close my eyes and lie down on my bed and transport my self to Notre Dame and be apart of the story and witness it.
246`3`The book was all about this hunchback and the hunchback was sexy in his own way. He falls in love with a gypsy and that gypsy has an amazing goat. The hunchback pushes his own father figure off the roof of a cathedral. The hunchback is sexy, bad, and different.Phoebus gets stabbed but he doesn't die. It's totally radical. Esmeralda killed him. JK, it was Frollo. Esmeralda gets sentenced to death because of Frollo. Quasimodo pushed Frollo off the cathedral for Esmeralda.
247`3`The ending ended me ü§ß
248`3`The meat of the story was pretty good. Classic tragedy, very intense gothic horror scenes, memorable and real characters. However, I do think it was needlessly burdened by a lot of what the author calls "philosophy" which might have some value but has aged considerably. And lots of discussion of gothic architecture and the author's own theory that architecture is the king of all the arts, the pinnacle and how unfortunate it is that people capture thoughts and communication through paper and words now instead of architecture. Didn't resonate with me.Oh, and Frollo is a very pathetic character. And Phoebus is a horrible selfish twit. Just needed to say that. I feel better now.
249`4`The novel falls short of greatness because it‚Äôs simply too operatic and absurd. A recluse living in a rat-hole, protecting the tiny shoe of the baby gypsies stole from her sixteen years ago. The coincidentally 16-year-old Esmeralda, stuck in a circular loop of capture and escape. The priest Claude Frollo is perhaps the least believable character ‚Äì a man who has done good his whole life, until he casts eyes on Esmeralda and becomes a celibate man obsessed, no longer able to tell right from wrong and good from evil. No, it‚Äôs not required that characters in the classics be totally believable, that they behave like moderns ‚Äì but Frollo, Esmeralda, and Quasimodo are characters in a fairy tale, caricatures more than humans. Esmeralda falls irreversibly in love with a callous but handsome soldier, Captain Phoebus de Chateaupers, because he rescues her from ne‚Äôer-do-wells one night; and like a duckling, she imprints on him and is unable to realize the idiocy of her love. The characters that resonate most are the most human ones: Gringoire, Phoebus, Djali. Phoebus was a horrible, delightful cad who would be at home in any Jane Austen novel.Unlike many other readers, I didn‚Äôt find the novel too long. The extensive digressions on architecture and the city of Paris are necessary; after all, the book is named for the cathedral (‚Äúthe hunchback‚Äù as a title came later, with English translations). Without the digressions, which is probably not even a fair term, the novel would be a really well written Grimm's fairy tale.This is one novel where a good translation is critical. I compared John Sturrock‚Äôs Penguin translation to a public domain translation and Sturrock‚Äôs was more vivid, colorful, and lively. I can see how a bad translation would make the novel seem interminable.
250`2`The only positive thing about this book that I can say is that it is eloquently and beautifully written.Reading this book was a huge drag and misery. Yes, the story itself wasn't that bad, even though it ended in the worst way possible, it was artistic and very melodramatic.The reason it was such a drag was because there were huge chunks of unnecessary chapters and comments about the architecture of Paris. Even the slightest little details about buildings were brought out which really gave absolutely nothing to the story it was about. It was like having a non-fiction historic book inside a fictional story, and a very anal one.The whole book felt like it was written by some artistic person who got distracted by every single building and a pebble on sight and had to take a stop in the middle of the story telling to marvel the shape of a rock found on the street.The ending just left me disappointed and feeling sad, nothing was gained from the book other than witnessing injustice and death of everything. It might be a classic but I found it extremely miserable. A typical story about who loves you - you don't love, and who you love - doesn't love you.
251`1`The second book I gave a grade 1.Funny thing I had the perception it would be a great book (it is famous, or at least Quasimodo is) so my expectations were high, unfortunately, this book sux.Where do I start?When you start reading the book, first 50 pages you think ok it will soon end with endless descriptions of the city, places, peoples, name-dropping, latin and all other things that basically have nothing with the story.Next 50 pages you think, ok this is really long build - up.When you get to the page 200 you are like screw this book, there is almost no story, just bunch of random stuff thrown into this bloody book so Victor Hugo can show off how smart and knowledgeable he is.Finally, the plot gets moving at page 300, but at that point, you won't care that much.But never fear, soon you will get more of the name - dropping.But even all of that wouldn't make me give this book 1, but ending was so stupid (really didn't understand what was the point of this whole story, if Hugo wanted to raise awareness about old building maybe he did, I don't know, book is famous so he probably did, but I have no idea why this book is classic or why anybody would like this book) and rushed and plot is stupid (girl is sentenced to death for killing a guy, even he didnt die and is walking freealy 10 days later).Horrible book, I really wanted to give grade 2 but book this bad doesn't deserve better.
252`null`The story of Quasimodo is a heart warming tale It takes place in Notre Dame, which is in France. Most of the time he is in a bell tower. The conflict of the story is acceptance. Nobody accepts Quasimodo as a person because he is different form other people. He was born with a hump on his back and deformed face features. When he was a small person he was locked in a bell tower where nobody could find him. This book for me was very different than what I was use to ever reading. I enjoyed most of the book. One reason I enjoyed the book is because it was just different. I have never read another book like it and that was very great. Another reason I enjoyed the book is because it was so far fetched. The way the characters were made them seem real, but the story itself: way to out there. One reason I did not enjoy the book is when Esmeralda dies. That was just insane. She was hung then thrown into a tomb where others have been thrown before. The people that I would recommend this book to are emos. This book is dark and not a lot of fun so it would be perfect for them. Plus there is a lot of dead people so that would work great for those emos. I would not recommend this to children because it is messed up. Overall I liked this book but I think the movie was much better. 
253`4`The storyline to this was just amazing. I loved the disney movie, but I had no illusions going into this that the story would be anything like that. I much prefered Phoebus' character in the book because lets be real, Quasimodo and Esmerelda belong together. Also I loved the character of Claude Frollo, he was just a superb villain and I loved actually hearing about his backstory and all the hardships he faced. It just makes him that much more realistic, since in real life usually no one is just evil and Hugo definitely shows Frollo's better side. The ending was so good as well, but I won't spoil it. I only really had two problems with this book and that was just the random pieces of French scattered throughout the text with no reasoning why the translator translated everything bar these phrases. And then there's what Hugo is world renowned for, his rambles. I am sorry but this book could have been 200 pages shorter if it wasn't for his completely pointless rants. The breakdown of Parisian architecture for up until the 1800s even though the novel is set in the 1400s didn't exactly add much to the story. If the rambles weren't in it I could have definitely given this book five stars. 
254`4`The tale of a cathedral and some injustices surrounding it.A tragic tale, full of dark irony, all coming to a train wreck. What could have caused such a tragedy? One priest with more entitlement than self-awareness (and possibly his brother).This book feels like one of the books that William Goldman was making fun of in The Princess Bride (the book) when he talks about the narrator's father skipping big sections of the book to get to the "good parts." Hugo writes extensively about the history of architecture, the history of Paris, and the history of the cathedral. This book was written to try to help drive reconstruction of the actual Notre Dame cathedral in the 19th century, with a catchy plot about some of the miniscule, antlike creatures (us, humans) who have drama as they surround it. The relative unimportance of the plots of us fragile humans kind of shows.I tried to read the sections about buildings, buildings, and more buildings, but ehhhh...I skimmed. The parts about humans and a certain goat were better, if still brutal and heavy-handed on the irony and tragedy. But this is a Hugo novel, so that was about par for the course.Recommend if you like architecture and tragedy. Don't expect a lot of cute.
255`3`The translation seemed dated, but it is a good story. I skip skimmed much of the description of Paris.
256`5`The well-known story of Quasimodo, the hunchback foundling who has lived all his life in the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris, the misanthropic priest who took care of him, the beautiful gypsy Esmeralda, and the Truands of the Paris underworld. I think this fits the "amazing" category to merit 5 stars, even if it is hard to get into and not perfect in its structure. I found the descriptions of 15th-century Paris a little turgid at times but once I was caught up in the story, I couldn't stop reading about the tortured souls who are at its centre. I did wish Esmeralda had a bit more gumption, however.
257`4`The writing is brilliant, the plot is unusual. But-- perhaps like in life-- where are the good guys? Esmerelda doesn't say much other than "Oh Pheobus!" She's a very flat character, imho. The book seems to be a study in love gone wrong-- romantic love, parental love, all gone wrong. There are examples of charitable love toward Quasimoto, and in the end he performs a selfless act for Esmerelda, but overall it was a very depressing look at love vs lust, and a study in what not to do. five stars for the writing itself (lovely), but docked a point because it leaves me discouraged with everyone.
258`4`There are so many excellent reviews of this book that I am reluctant to add one of mine. Unfortunately, due to my poor French abilities, I had to rely to translations of the book. I was surprised that the name was changed from the original French of Notre-Dame de Paris to The Hunchback of Notre-Dame in English, it is evident that Hugo intent was to focus on Paris in general and the Cathedral in particular rather than on the hunchback role. I didn‚Äôt know that this novel spurred an interest into Gothic revival and, later on, the historical preservation and restoration of monuments of national importance under the direction of Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc . He is the fellow who led the restoration of the cathedral itself as well as of buildings at V√©zelay, Mont Saint-Michel and Carcassonne.I enjoyed the story very much (much more than the famous Les Mis√©rables, written 30 years later). I liked the fights and struggles amongst and between the social strata: nobility and clergy vs working classes of merchants and populace; even beggars and thieves have important roles in the story. I also appreciated the complexity of the characters; the Archdeacon is not a typical anti-hero. Frollo‚Äôs character starts as compassionate towards Quasimodo and devoted to his brother before he starts venting his frustrations at his failures as a teacher, brother and lover and eventually falling into madness. In my opinion, Esmeralda is not as well developed; she is a charming and exotic beauty but she reveal herself as a typical teen, in love with a romantic ideal of love ("a man and a woman blending into an angel"), but sadly lacking soul. Quasimodo is the predictable hero, devoted to his beloved Cathedral, his purity balances the obvious deformity. He is a mirror of the evil world and the ugliness of the people that surrounds him. Hugo‚Äôs irony shows in the description of how the Parisians enjoy Quasimodo's "singing" while at the same time detest and are repulsed by his ugliness.At times, I found the story melodramatic (in particular the scene in Sister Gudule‚Äôs cell) but mine is probably a modern reaction to the Romantic Movement themes of the novel. Favourite quote:Love is like a tree; it grows spontaneously, strikes its roots deep into our whole being, and often continues to flourish over a heart in ruins.And the inexplicable part of it is, that the blinder this passion, the more tenacious it is. It is never stronger than when it is utterly unreasonable.
259`3`There is no denying Victor Hugo's skill but this is a seriously long read. The descriptive narrative is lovely but if like me you are just reading this as a story and not as a student of literature then read an abridged version. The descriptions of the architecture of Paris are wonderful but when it's late at night and the weight of the book is killing your hand it's a bit hard to fully appreciate the beauty of the language.
260`1`There's a reason they've created an abridged version. Don't get me wrong, I like detail and description, but not to the point where it's all I'm reading. This just couldn't keep me engaged at all.
261`2`This book felt like a marathon - I had to grit my teeth and tell myself to keep going. Some (small) parts were absolutely brilliant and I couldn't stop reading, but for the most part I found myself skimming over pages and pages of tedious descriptions. The whole story sort of seems pointless to me - and I appreciate that may be because I'm just uncultured and not picking up the deeper nuances of this book. At the end of the day, reading is either about learning new information or enjoying yourself, and this book achieved neither purpose for me.
262`4`This book has some deeply moving parts like when Esmeralda and the recluse meet and recognize each other then depicting the love of a mother for her daughter.such parts as above will bear reading over and over ( what I ca;ll a 6 star) part unparalleled in all of literature . The story starts out 3-4 stars then Hugo launches into a 1.5-2 hour tour guide of french architectural history which I recommend the reader skip and then the last part of the story is 4-5 stars I would have given this book 5 stars excepts for the all the meaningless and tragic l killing ( Quasimodo clashed with the vagabonds when both have the same objective !!!!! . ( everyone in the story except the villain dies ) which makes Hugo seem like a jerk( glad my destiny's not in his hands) . But the part about Esmeralda meeting the recluse is so good that it pulls the book up to at least 4 stars and should be read again and again. the rest is 3-4 stars except 2 hour the tour de France hugo inserts half way through which is 1-2 stars and can easily be skippedDo read it again and again every few years as it does depict the purest type available on the planet and is clean of sexual content
263`4`This book is amazing. AMAZING. I would like to say though that if you are going to attempt to read this then get ready to struggle through the beginning. I was so confused. It starts out in some sort of "mystery" which is a play. I still have no idea why that was even going on. The there is a chapter about what Notre Dame looks like which is a good chapter. But the chapter right after is about what Paris looks like from the top of Notre Dame. And this chapter goes on and on and on. I was ok ... but then everything started sounding the same and it was just crazy. I know some people like abridged novels but not me. I feel like if I am reading an abridged one then I am not really reading the book. So I went out of my way to find the unabridged. One thing that surprised me the most about this book is that Quasimodo is not the main character. Most of the book concentrates on Frollo who is the priest of Notre Dame. He is in love with Esmeralda... and is really crazy over her. We are talking psycho crazy. So crazy that he kills Esmeralda's love Phoebus. Esmeralda is accused of the murder and since she is a gypsy she really has no chance of anyone siding with her. This books ends tragically too. TRAGIC! Not the happily ever after ending that we expect in books.This book makes me want to visit Notre Dame. Alas.. I will never get there. But I have seen the National Cathedral in Washington DC and so I have seen a rose window in person and they are beautiful. I finished this book in like 4 days. I mean I couldn't put it down.. and hour of reading would go by and I didn't even realize it. I love this book!http://angelasanxiouslife.blogspot.co...
264`5`This book is an epic, and yet surprisingly quick read. I won‚Äôt try to compare it to the one adaptation I‚Äôve seen of the hunchback story (that being the disney animated version) as it has been more than a decade since I‚Äôve seen it and the two don‚Äôt seem compatible or even really comparable. The characters all seem, and this is despite the many fantastical elements hinted at, very real. Claude Frollo is deeply flawed and at the same time incredibly bright, a slave to his lust for Esmeralda and the inescapable rational truth that he will be crushed by his obsession. Esmeralda herself is an interesting creation, exotic beauty on the outside, ignorant but well meaning child in her actions. But for me, the story rests on two sets of shoulders. One being Quasimodo, the only really ‚Äòpure‚Äô character in the book scarred by his own birth and the ignorance of his age. And two, Hugo‚Äôs own narrative voice that creates a Paris so vividly described and realistically inhabited that the events described, as incredibly horrific or at times magnificent, seem plausible, or even real.  
265`3`This book was far more disturbing than I had anticipated.
266`5`This book was not what I expected at all. Well, yes I knew that the book by Victor Hugo is not as uplifting as the Disney movie of the same title, to say the least. And from reading Les Miserables (one of my personal favorites) I knew to expect at least a few chapters about obscure subjects, like the topografy of Paris and political relationships between different factions. I expected this book to be quite tragic, to be honest.And I got those things. The book does not end happily like the Disney movie and hasn't got dancing and singing statues (though Quasimodo talks with them in the novel too). It has some lengthy parts that seem to describe every building in Paris, especially in the first half, that make entering into the story a bit hard. And yes, it's dramatic. But what surprised me most was the way my expectations were not met. The book was not direly serious, but humorous, with biting remarks, hilarious conversations, (Pierre Gringoire has the gift of gab to be sure, and who can forgat the judge and Quasimodo). I almost constantly had a smirk on my face, reading another to the point description of inhumane practices in the middle ages. The characters were rich. Quasimodo is not the main character, but has a touching story, and Claude Frollo is amazingly portrayed in his struggle with lust. Phoebus turned out to be an insensitive womanizer, and Esmeralda a naive waif not seeing the warning signs. And then there's the goat ... At the end of the book the pace picks up, and the last chapters are hard to put down, with a chilling siege of the kathedral, a heart wrenching unexpected reunion, and a touching final moment. I will read this book again and think more of the themes therein. Hugo undoubtedly meant for the Hunchback to be a commentary on the times he lived in, but he also writes about different types of love as commonly understood, which turn out to be false, or forms of self love, or lust. Without mercy he shows how people deceive themselves by calling their feelings love, as if that makes them good. Self-sacrifice is love, is his point. Not that self-sacrifice leads to a happy end (as it also didn't in Les Miserables), but it is real love. The rest isn't. In a tale about a church, God is conspicuously absent. Frollo wrestles with Gods seeming incapacity to quench his lust and save him from temptation. And there's a woman accusing God of taking away her child, not willing to accept that God could tolerate suffering. Hugo doesn't give any easy answers, luckily, but I know from Les Miserables that he is not a man without faith. Then, where is God found in this novel? In the self-sacrificing love, no other.A classic, and one to read again!
267`2`This book was one of the most arduous reads ever!!! I can‚Äôt remember the last time it took me a month to read a book.This is a story of love and obsession. It‚Äôs centre point is the Notre Dame Cathedral. There were so many side characters and interruptions, the story just bogged down. All I want to know is where was Quasimodo, the ‚ÄúHunchback of Notre Dame.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt really figure for at least two thirds of the book. The highlights were when he was front and centre, otherwise the book was a total slog and sleep inducer.I read this book for my classics group, so to be honest, I would not have finished it otherwise.
268`3`This book was originally titled "Notre Dame de Paris" and I think that's a much better choice. I was vaguely familiar with the story, or at least I thought I was, probably like most people who haven't read it. I was wrong. Quasimodo, the hunchback (a name so well known my spellchecker recognizes it) is actually not only NOT the main character, he's not in a lot of the book. It's largely the story of Esmeralda, a stunningly beautiful gypsy street dancer, and the men that fall in love with her. They include Claude Frollo, an archdeacon who gets completely obsessed with her (he'd definitely be a stalker in the modern world), Pheobus, a vain and strutting soldier, and the infamous Quasimodo. Frollo sets in motion a lot of the tragedy of the story by his increasingly demented acts of "love." There are many plot twists, including a trial for the murder (even though the "victim" survived), a battle of street rabble vs. soldiers, the fate of two lost children revealed at different times, and a magic goat (sorta). Among the other characters are Jehan, Claude's ne'er-do-well brother, and a playwright who seems to get blown wherever the winds take him. Paris is arguably a character itself. There's a lot of time spent on the city's history, people, and architecture. There's even a chapter that muses on the idea that literature replaced architecture as the main way to record history. The story wanders a lot, actually, which I expected having read Les Mis√©rables.I won't do a lot of spoilers, but I will say that if you're expecting a Disney type happy ending, you're reading the wrong book. I've heard the joke that Shakespeare never wrote sequels because most of his characters died off in many of his plays. There's not going to be a sequel here. Enough randomly cruel things happen to make me wonder if George R R Martin read this early in his career. 
269`5`This book was so good I started reading it after the fire at the church at Notre Dame I always wanted to read it but kept putting it off, the fire kind of kick-started my passion to want to read it. Im happy that I did it seems to be a trend with me books that I put off reading end up being the best books. The book started off slow but only because the author really set interest in describing the architecture and structures of the majority of the churches and buildings of the city. There was a lot of character development and little details that frustrated me at first but I appreciate now. It took me a long time to get through the book because of the slow start to the story but once it picked up speed it was so interesting. I'm happy I finally got around the reading this book. I enjoyed the plot twists and turns and how everything finished up nicely. 
270`4`This book would be a five star one if not for the fact that Victor Hugo insists upon describing everything and everyone in tedious detail, even, and perhaps most especially, when it is entirely irrelevant. I know part of it is probably just the style from back then, so I forgave it a bit. Also having read Les Miserables, I was already prepared for a bunch of details I could just skip in the writing. And skip them I did. As for the actual story, Hugo did not fail to impress me. While it was not, perhaps, as good as Les Miserables, the plot was still good, and the characters (for the most part) very well put together. Disney totally butchered this book, by the way. I tried watching the movie while reading this, and it was like two different stories. Frollo is not the definate "bad guy". Actually, I thought he was the best character, if not a bit weird and obsessive. All the characters are ambiguous. One could easily say that anyone was the villian, and all the others victims. Personally, Pheobus seemed like the villian to me. He was just a player, for lack of a better word.It would have better if Esmeralda had loved Quasimodo, Gringoire, or even Frollo. But as always, the pretty face got chosen before heart, brains, or passion. That's probably why this book is so good. In reality, pretty girls don't typically choose men that are best for them over the ones who are good looking. Which is a shame for all of them, because the story ultimately ends in sadness for all but of course, the hot guy(who deserves to fall off the roof of Notre-Dame or get hanged more than anyone) loses nothing. A lot of people will hate this book because of it's reality and bitterness, but I enjoyed it because of the fact. I have a host of new characters to enjoy (Jehan, Claude Frollo, Gringoire), and another very good classic under my belt. One thing suprised me, I didn't like Quasimodo as much as I anticipated. He seemed like someone I'd enjoy, and I didn't particularly. All in all, a good book. Just skip some of the descriptions, or get an abriged version, and you'll be fine. 
271`5`This has been on my 'to-read' list ever since I read "Les Miserables" 23 years ago. So glad I finally got around to it, but also glad I waited until I was well into adulthood so I could appreciate Hugo's lengthy descriptions of medieval Paris and his love of Gothic architecture. Living in a city (Los Angeles/Hollywood) where there has been massive building projects and urban reorganization in the last decade, I fully appreciate Hugo's lamentation about what has been lost through growth and disregard. Had I read this as a teen, I would have skipped past such chapters in order to focus strictly on the plot. However, these now thrill me as I recognize the artistry of a writer masterly describing a subject he loves (like Melville and whaling or Jeanette Winterson and the late-Industrial northern England). What to say about the plot and the characters? Phoebus and Gringoire are not as charming here as they tend to be in the film versions, but Claude Frollo is not quite as evil. He is terribly flawed and misguided, but he has had humanity in the past and nearly regains it in the end. Esmeralda is lacking, unfortunately, not quite as strong as I was accustomed to seeing in the movies. However, the plot's conclusion is incredibly disturbing and sad. I wish that Esmeralda had not been so blind (or deaf, since that is a recurring theme) to the fact that Phoebus is not a great guy. For me, it undercut her portrayal as acting with true Christian kindness and forgiveness (despite being the only non-Christian) that she continued to worship Phoebus and stayed wary of Quasimodo.I would have preferred the story to be more focused in the final third of the novel. Just as the plot is kicking into high gear, we have a long digression with Louis XI which I found frustrating. Because of this I almost gave the book 4 stars, but when I took into consideration that Hugo took me to another world which was also seen through the prism of the Catholic Reformation, the French Revolution and the July Revolution (and that I understood whichever axe he had to grind, despite the book being 183 years old), I had to give it 5 stars. I also appreciated Hugo's assertion that although most of the characters are orphans in some way, there are other forms of makeshift kinship that bond them. And I love how Quasimodo and Esmeralda end up inventing the world's first rape whistle.
272`5`This is a beautiful novel of hope, prejudice, history, love, philosophy, and...architecture. In fact, the entire story centers not around the extraordinary main characters, but the cathedral itself (as is more evident in the original title, Notre Dame de Paris). As strange of a concept as it sounds, Hugo is able to pull it off with ease, creating the perfect atmosphere for such a novel.A good rule of thumb with Victor Hugo is to pay the utmost attention to what you are reading; the man is a master with dark and clever puns, metaphors, and personification. There is no sentence that the book could do without, and it is best to give The Hunchback of Notre Dame the effort it is worth.There is not one thing I could find fault with in this book, but if you are one to get uneasy with novels with cruelty, misery and death as a factor, you may find yourself shifting in your seat a bit. 
273`3`This is a book that I will reread at some point. I was enticed by the historical setting but felt t g at the pace and development of the plot was like riding a rollercoaster.
274`4`This is a strange and wonderful book. Strange mostly because it's a bit of a mess, structurally speaking. The pacing is a disaster and the historical asides that were well-plotted and -paced in Les Mis are just plain out of place here (however interesting). Also, strange because it doesn't end in any way like the movies lead you to expect. But, for all its glaring problems, it's still a tour de force of character--especially when it comes to the minor character of the hunchback who continues to steal the imaginations of generations.
275`4`This is a tough book to review - there is just SO much here. I will say that I started off with the full book [and was both lost and rather bored almost immediately] and then my friend Joy [who I was doing this as a Buddy-Read with] found this delightful abridged version which keeps the story intact but takes out a lot of the "extras" of the book. It made it a much more delightful read and I would recommend this version to anyone. I will also say that if you are expecting something similar to the Disney version without the music, you will be greatly surprised. Greatly. I believe that they waved the book over the script, gave the main characters all the correct names and then made a animated musical version that had very little to do with the actual book. There was so much here that I was surprised about. The only thing that Disney DID get right is how creepy and nasty Claude Frollo is. Blech. 
276`4`This is an amazing book but I would advise it for older audiences as it contains several sexual references. This book also has a couple chapters such as the description of the church of Notre Dam which tend to seem long and rambly.
277`4`This is an impressive books. Victor Hugo writes his character with such flare and spirit that you are able to see them and follow along. You have the story of Quasimodo, the hunchback who lives in the bell towers of Notre Dame. He is reviled by everyone but Claude Frollo, the archbishop and his master.Enter Esmerelda, a travelling gypsy, who comes to Paris to entertain and earn money. Immediately both men become obsessed with her. For Frollo, she is a forbidden object of desire and for Quasimodo, she has shown him kindness, something unexpected. Unfortunately his desire to keep her safe contradicts Frollo's desire to possess Esmerelda. Therefore Quasimodo is torn between loyalty and love.There are other characters such as Gringoire the poet who works the streets with Esmerelda, Sachette the old women who hates Esmerelda, and Phoebus the captain who longs to bed her. Yes, even though the title is about the Hunchback, it is Esmerelda's book. Even when she is not on the page, the other characters are thinking about her. I think it was quite nice of Victor Hugo to name the book after someone else and give her a break.Hugo would go off on tangents of 30 pages in which he would describe scenery or history that really had no point to the story. Other then that, it was a five star book.
278`5`This is definitely my favourite classic, I loved the dark atmosphere of the book, and the setting being Notre-Dame, which is one of my favourite places in Paris. It's not entirely dark and horrible, there are times when it can be humorous, but it's brutal in terms of showing what obsession can become when it's misunderstood as love and the true form of love shown by other characters. When starting this book, it was really difficult to get into which is why I had to force myself to keep reading until about 60 pages in (with the introduction) when I got into the plot. The story follows different characters, as well as flashbacks and Hugo's knowledge of Notre-Dame and Paris as a city. I also love how the cathedral is a metaphor for beauty and the beast as a balanced whole‚Äî the gargoyles being a representation of Quasimodo and the famous Rose window being Esmeralda, 2 distinct features of the cathedral. *spoilers ahead*I didn't like Frollo at all, I found him to be a fucking creeper and I didn't sympathize at all with him, and I'm baffled as how people could love him. the stuff he did was sickening:‚Äî the attempted rape of Esmeralda, forcing her to love him, laughing when she was hanged, not even caring for his adopted son, Quasimodo, when he was being jeered by the crowd. He was nasty and I didn't feel for him at all, because he didn't deserve to be sympathized with. Esmeralda, as much as I liked her for being compassionate towards Quasimodo, was shallow and naive. I could have played a drinking game as to how many times she says Phoebus' name during her scenes. She was foolish and pathetically in love with Phoebus because he was handsome when really he was cold and lecherous and only wanted to get in her pants. Like Frollo, she thought that lust was love, when really it was not. The story was heart-breaking and tragic, it really showed how appearances and social positions in society can be deceiving, and how cruel it could be for individuals who were good. Overall rating is 4.5 
279`3`This is one book that is hard to rate. I absolutely hated the first part. I started this book about 4 weeks ago and I just could not do it. I kept thinking, "Where is the magic that I LOVED in Les Miserables?" This was so tedious, I had to just walk away.Unfortunately, I still needed this book for a book challenge. So I picked it back up and started where I left off. It wasn't as awful as I remembered. But it still wasn't magical (that is what I was expecting). I felt a little disappointed. By the end, I liked this way more than I would have ever expected given how I reacted to the beginning. I'm glad I finished it. There were some great thought-provoking themes and social situations that would have made this a great read for BOOK CLUB or something like that. Considering everything, I can only give 3 stars. The start was rough and I still shudder at the thought.
280`4`This is one of my first "proper" reads and probably my first "The-book-is-better-than-the-movie" lol, I loved it at the time, I just loved everything about Esmeralda and how bad ass she was and how she stood up for Quasimodo. I think this is a perfect read for children. 
281`4`This is quite a tome, and it requires both patience and time to get through. Hugo is prone to digressions, some of which stretch on for at least fifteen pages (I was listening to an audiobook recording, and a number of the digressions went on for at least fifteen minutes). The lengthy asides are devoted to describing in elaborate detail the architecture and geography of fifteenth-century Paris, background which imparts the novel with a deeper sense of authenticity than it would have possessed had Hugo kept his narrative focus solely on his characters. Nevertheless, this reader was left wishing Hugo had refrained from sidelining them for as many pages as he did in order to indulge in his love for what he evidently believed to be the height of Parisian artistry.Though these asides ‚Äì educational as they are ‚Äì can be tiresome, Hugo‚Äôs characters ultimately take precedence in the novel, and it is their struggles which impart the novel with lasting value as a story. His three main characters ‚Äì Quasimodo, Esmeralda, and the Archdeacon Frollo ‚Äì are not always sympathetic, but are consistently intriguing because they are motivated by the primal human emotions of lust and love. Through them, Hugo effectively shows the harm which one acting on lust can bring to a person who pursues love at any cost.Quasimodo, the eponymous hunchback, is a character who pursues love at any cost ‚Äì a love for Esmeralda which is especially selfless because he understands that she will always be repulsed by his deformities. Quasmodo‚Äôs devotedness to Esmeralda coupled with his inability to connect to the world around him makes him easily sympathetic, despite his occasionally violent behavior. However, it is this same isolation which make him the least engaging of the three main characters. While Esmeralda and Frollo can verbally spar and passionately express their emotions to one another, Quasimodo can barely communicate and remains in the cathedral throughout most of the story while the action continues below him. He is always compelling when he enters into the main action of the story, at which points he validates his status as the titular character by drastically altering the plot, but it is difficult to feel as strongly about his fate as though characters whom are continually at the reader‚Äôs attention.Esmeralda falls in to that category, as she is a character who elicits a strong emotional reaction from the reader, though not necessarily a positive one. Unlike Quasimodo, Esmeralda cannot accept that the person whom she loves ‚Äì the captain Phoebus who is entirely driven by lust ‚Äì does not love her. It is this stubbornness which enables the reader to empathize with her while also becoming incredibly frustrated by her. Her cries of ‚ÄúPhoebus! Oh where is my Phoebus?‚Äù can become annoying, because they indicate a desperation which is both understandable and uncomfortable to read about. Some might, perhaps rightly, accuse Hugo of sexism in his portrayal of a woman who becomes utterly dependent on a man‚Äôs approval and acceptance, but her plight also speaks truthfully to the debilitating power love can have over an person, and to the larger damage a casually cruel person like Phoebus can unknowingly inflict.Archdeacon Frollo‚Äôs cruelty, like Phoebus‚Äôs, is borne out of lust, but Frollo is more cognizant of the consequences of his choices than is Phoebus. He is arguably the most fascinating character in the novel because he, like Esmeralda, struggles with desire ‚Äì in his case, a lustful desire ‚Äì for a person who does not love him, but whereas she only had to fear for her temporal life, he is fully believes that pursuing his feelings will lead him to spiritual damnation. He is given the choice between selfless devotion and self-gratification, and chooses the latter in spite of the consequences to himself and everyone else. Though in this he becomes objectively despicable, the reader continues to be intrigued by and perhaps to feel a remnant of sympathy for him, because he is tormented by such an inescapable and universal emotion as lust. The complexity of his inner torment is arguably the strongest aspect of the novel, and a great example of how good writing can depict a believable villain.While the conflict between love and lust is well depicted, Hugo must also be praised for injecting his story with enough humor to keep the story from becoming melodramatic. The narrator‚Äôs occasionally wry tone and mockery of Parisian government provides the opportunity for laughter, though some of the history he references may seem obscure to the modern reader. The character of Gringoire, the pitiful philosopher who tends to value his survival over anything else, is able to provide a steady stream of sarcasm throughout much of the story, as he is free of most of the personal attachments that plague the other characters.By the end of the book, the reader may think he is wisest character of all, because Hugo does not allow those of his characters who love much happiness. In this, his depiction of love could be said to be one-sided, if not untruthful. He presents a powerful depiction of lust foiling love, without accounting for the possibility that in some cases, love might just come out the winner.
282`5`This is so much a redone work, that few would ever consider that it began life as a historical novel. Just like Les Miserables is historical so is this. It takes place in medieval times and it tells of a supposedly celibate priest who falls in love with a gypsy, as does everyone else in the novel, inclduding the ugly bellringing hunchback. She is the notorius lady of the title, Hugo's version of Mary Magdeline, a type he would return to in Les Miserables. She is a victim even though everyone supposedly loves her. I enjoyed reading this.
283`5`This is the first book of Victor Hugo that I have read and all I can say is "wowza". What a complex, beautiful, disturbing, and heartbreaking tale. Only once has a classic captured my heart and mind so completely (Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice); I didn't think I'd ever find another I adored as much but it's finally happened. Disney changed this novel so much that I'm almost saddened by the times I watched it and thought what a great musical it was. Haha younger me really thought it was a musical for the longest time until I was 14 years old.I'll be honest and say you must be prepared for some boring parts. Victor Hugo was a big lover of Notre Dame's architecture and Paris so there are many passages and dedicated to detailed descriptions of both. The first 100 pages weren't the best either but you do get introduced to a couple main characters and see what the Parisians are like. If you get past those parts you get a look into wonderful examples of philosophy and psychology through the characters and what they live through. You can't help but recognize yourself and others in the characters at times, which is kind of scary and off-putting at times since nobody wants to be like Archdeacon Claude Frollo.My overall rating would be 4.5 since the boring parts weren't my favorite but I think all were necessary in making points or helping to know the characters more. I can't believe I waited so long to read this book. Everyone needs to at some point in their life.
284`4`This is the first time I've ever read this. It was very moving at times but, at times, it was a bit verbose. The end was a surprise to me. I was very moved.
285`4`This is the translation for "Notre-Dame of Paris". Penguin has done the translation very well. After failing two attempts with this novel I finally settled myself with Penguin and it is the best I've come across with very readable English. I really enjoyed this edition.This does not compete with Hugo's Les Miserables (there aren't many novels that do) and that is because Les Mis title did not misled the readers. As you may be aware already, the English title "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" is a fallcy; Quasimodo is NOT the main character; he is barely even a secondary character. The original is called Notre-dame de Paris, which tells exactly what the novel focuses on. But English title lets us assume that it is the story of Hunchback as hero, while the original title asserts it is story set in Notre-dame and has characters who reside in it, or live in its shadows. In the novel, Hugo gives his viewpoints about society ( prevalent at that time ) and church and their influence ( oppression ) of humanity. We see recurring themes regarding the nature of the church and certain politico-economical systems which serve to enslave humanity. The result is revolution another recurring theme in Hugo's books.Disney and all the movie versions so far has butchered this story. Not one version tells the story as Hugo intended. Forget all the movie versions and just read the book. The experience is MUCH rewarding intellectually than any of them.
286`4`This isn't a review of the book itself, but rather a sampler of its English translations. Since the ratio of English readers of Hugo to English translators of Hugo is perilously close to 1:1, I thought a quick taste test was in order, so I've whipped up this plateau d'amuse-gueules so that you can find your favorite. I've compiled as many versions of the opening paragraph(s) as I could find online; I had no luck unearthing Hazlitt [1833], but most of the others are here. I've ended with Hugo's original French, the essence of which will be surprisingly intelligible after you've parsed it against a couple of the less impressionistic translations. (Just for fun, I've added my own translation at the end, so you can see whether my opinion is worth a crap.) Please click 'Like' if you found this useful - it will make it easier for other people to find it!If you want an opinion without having to slog through all these, I think the only ones close to great literature in English are Beckwith [1895] and maybe Sturrock [1978], who seems to follow Beckwith rather closely. Beckwith is quite good, with Sturrock a notch below, and all the rest defacing Hugo as much as his detested 'masons' were then defacing the medieval facade of Paris.:: Shoberl [1833] ::On this day 348 years, six months, and nineteen days since the good people of Paris were awakened by a grand peal from all the bells in the three districts of the City, the University, and the Ville. The 6th of January, 1482, was, nevertheless, a day of which history has not preserved any record. There was nothing worthy of note in the event which so early set in motion the bells and the citizens of Paris. It was neither an assault of the Picards or the Burgundians, nor a procession with the shrine of some saint, nor a mutiny of the students, nor an entry of our "most redoubted lord, Monsieur the king," nor even an execution of rogues of either sex, before the Palace of Justice of Paris. Neither was it an arrival of some bedizened and befeathered embassy, a sight of frequent occurrence in the fifteenth century. It was but two days since the last cavalcade of this kind, that of the Flemish ambassadors commissioned to conclude a marriage between the Dauphin and Margaret of Flanders, had made its entry into Paris, to the great annoyance of the Cardinal of Bourbon, who, in order to please the king, had been obliged to receive this vulgar squad of Flemish burgomasters with good grace, and to entertain them at his hotel de Bourbon with a goodly morality, mummery, and farce, while a deluge of rain drenched the magnificent tapestry at his door. :: Anonymous [19th century, adopted by Everyman's Library] ::On the 6th of January, 1482, the Parisians were awakened by the noise of all the bells within the triple circuit of the City, the University, and the Town ringing in full peal. Yet this is not a day of which history has preserved any remembrance. There was nothing remarkable in the event which thus put in agitation so early in the morning the bells and the good people of Paris. It was neither an assault of Picards or of Burgundians; nor a shrine carried in procession; nor a revolt of scholars in la vigne de Laas; nor an entry of notre dit tres-redoute seigneur Monsieur le Roi - that is, in plain English, of their most dread lord the King ["In good plain English"!? - Matvei]; nor yet a good hanging up of thieves, male and female, at the Justice de Paris (justice and gibbet having been synonymous in the good old feudal times)[That remark is also actually in the translation - Matvei].

And yet the 6th of January, 1842, is not a day of which history takes much note. There was nothing extraordinary about the event which thus set all the bells and the citizens of Paris agog from early dawn. It was neither an attack from the Picards or the Burgundians, nor some shrine carried in procession, nor was it a student revolt in the Ville de Laas, nor an entry of "our greatly to be dreaded lord the king", nor even the wholesale slaughter of a band of thieves before the Palace of Justice. Neither was it the arrival, so frequent during the 15th century, of some plumed and laced embassy. It was scarcely two days since the last cavalcade of this sort, that of the Flemish ambassadors empowered to arrange a marriage between the Dauphin and Marguerite of Flanders, had entered Paris, to the great annoyance of Cardinal Bourbon, who, to please the king, was forced to smile upon all this rustic rout of Flemish burgomasters, and to entertain them at his own mansion with "a very fine morality and farce", while a driving rainstorm drenched the splendid tapestries at his door. :: Hapgood [1888] :: Three hundred and forty-eight years, six months, and nineteen days ago today, the Parisians awoke to the sound of all the bells in the triple circuit of the city, the university, and the town ringing a full peal. The sixth of January, 1482, is not, however, a day of which history has preserved the memory. There was nothing notable in the event which thus set the bells and the bourgeois of Paris in a ferment from early morning.

Neither was it the arrival, so frequent in the fifteenth century, of some plumed and bedizened embassy. It was barely two days since the last cavalcade of that nature, that of the Flemish ambassadors charged with concluding the marriage between the dauphin and Marguerite of Flanders, had made its entry into Paris, to the great annoyance of M. le Cardinal de Bourbon, who, for the sake of pleasing the king, had been obliged to assume an amiable mien towards this whole rustic rabble of Flemish burgomasters, and to regale them at his H√¥tel de Bourbon, with a very "pretty morality, allegorical satire, and farce," while a driving rain drenched the magnificent tapestries at his door.:: Beckwith [1895] ::Exactly 348 years, six months, and nineteen days have passed away since the Parisians were awakened by the noise of all the bells within the triple walls of the city, the University, and the town, ringing a full peal.

There was nothing remarkable in the event which thus put in agitation so early in the morning the bells and the good people of Paris. It was neither an assault of the Picards or of the Burgundians, nor a shrine carried in procession, nor a revolt of scholars in the vigne de Laas, nor an entry of their most dread lord the king, nor a grand hanging up of thieves, male and female, at the Justice de Paris.

Yet history has kept no memory of this date, for there was nothing notable about the event which set in motion the bells and citizens of Paris that morning. It was not an attack by the Picards or the Burgundians, a procession carrying the relics of some saint, an entry of "Our Most Dread Lord, Monsieur the King," nor even a good hanging of thieves. Nor was it the arrival of some foreign ambassador and his train, all decked out in lace and feathers, a common sight in the 15th century. It had been scarcely two days since the latest cavalcade of this kind had paraded through the streets: the delegation of Flemish ambassadors sent to conclude the marriage between the Dauphin and Marguerite of Flanders. To his great annoyance, Cardinal de Bourbon, in order to please the king, had been obliged to give a gracious reception to that uncouth band of Flemish burgomasters and entertain them in his mansion. [Yes, Bair omitted the driving rain drenching the tapestries! - Matvei]:: Unknown (though after you read this, it will be clear that the translator was Alan Smithee) [Wordsworth Classics edition - perhaps Cobb 1964?] ::One morning, 348 years, six months, and nineteen days ago, the Parisians were awakened by a grand peal from all the bells, within the triple enclosure of the City, the University, and the Town. Yet the 6th of January, 1482, was not a day of which history has preserved any record. There was nothing remarkable in the event that so early in the morning set in commotion the bells and the bourgeois of Paris. It was neither a sudden attack made by Picards or by Burgundians, nor a shrine carried in procession, nor a student fight in the city of Laas, nor the entry of 'our most dread lord the King', nor even a goodly stringing up of thieves, male and female, on the Place de la Justice. Nor it was it a sudden arrival, so common in the 15th century, of some ambassador and his train, all belaced and beplumed. Only about two days ago, indeed, the last cavalcade of this kind, Flemish envoys commissioned to conclude the marriage treaty between the young dauphin and Marguerite of Flanders, had made entry into Paris, to the great annoyance of Cardinal Bourbon. To please the king, his Eminence had undertaken to give gracious reception to the rough crowd of Flemish burgomasters, and to entertain them at his Hotel de Bourbon with a 'very fine morality, burletta, and farce,' whilst a beating rain was all the time drenching his magnificent tapestries at his portals. :: Sturrock [1978] ::348 years, six months, and nineteen days ago today, the people of Paris awoke to hear all the churchbells in the triple enclosure of the City, the University, and the Town in full voice.

Yet the 6th of January, 1482, was not otherwise a day that history records. There was nothing remarkable in the event which, all that morning, had set the bells of Paris and her dwellers so astir. It was no invasion from Picardy or Burgundy, no solemn procession of relics to a shrine, no revolt of scholars from the vineyards of Laas, no entrance of our most dread lord the king, no fine hanging of thieves at the Palace of Justice. Nor was it the sudden arrival, so frequent in those days, of some ambassador, richly brocaded and beplumed. It had been two days since the last such parade -- that of the Flemish ambassadors tasked with confirming the marriage between the dauphin and Marguerite of Flanders -- had made its way to Paris, to the great annoyance of the cardinal of Bourbon, who, to please the king, had had to welcome this bumpkin lot of Flemish worthies to his estate and there regale them with mummeries and farces, as all the while a driving rain drenched the magnificent tapestries at his door. 
287`3`This may be the oldest soap opera in existence. I enjoyed much of the story but Hugo had this way of taking one scene or description and turning into this extraordinarily long-winded multi-page scene or description that was exhausting. I tuned the cathedral architecture out so completely that I was suddenly like "Oh! People are talking! How long has that been happening?" Those parts kind of drove me crazy. And the "I love you" confession of Esmeralda's enemy felt like it took five pages. The first time. We got that treat a few times.But I did really enjoy the writing outside of those moments. I enjoyed most of the story and I enjoyed seeing the origins of The Phantom of the Opera. Especially since the Gerard Butler/Emmy Rossum movie is one of my all time favorites. There's much to enjoy here.
288`5`This novel is far from the version of the disney movie, the novel is way more dark and tragic but I still highly recommend it. There is some dull moments though and takes a while until the (true) story Begins. But Notre Dame is my favorite building in Paris so offcourse I have to like this ;)The hunchback of Notre Dame get a 8.7/10 stars.
289`2`This novel was a disappointing read. Disappointing because Les Miserable was so good. The tragic story is in itself a good one - and of course with the tragic hero climbing around at the top of Notre Dame as it's main imaginative creation. The other characters are deeply flawed: One proud priest - a pompous poet - an angry hysterical and secluded woman, a violent captain and of course the irritatingly vain Esmeralda. The writing is full of over-the-top emotions, theatrical outbursts en masse and the characters remain very stereotype. It's very difficult to take serious in any way. To make matters worse, Hugo decides to insert long chapters on the history of Paris and a detail description of Notre Dame and other historical stuff. Come on, Hugo. Do we have to inspect every single corner of that church?The Huncback have been retold many times, and it might work very well as an opera or in an very abridged retold version for children. As it is read here - the original story - it's a no go.
290`2`This story is unrelentingly unhappy. I personally do not enjoy reading such stories. I can find plenty of unrelenting unhappiness in the real world, so when I read I like to read stories that leave me with an uplifted feeling. The book is generally well written although Hugo goes off on two lengthy tangents that completely stall the plot in the first half of the book. One on the layout of 15th century Paris and another is a philosophical treatise on how the invention of the printing press marked the end of architecture as the main method of artistic expression.
291`4`This was a lot of fun. The melodrama & suspense, certain infuriating characters (and fewer essay-like digressions than Les Mis) kept me turning pages to find out what happened next. And while I enjoyed this more than Les Mis, I have to also admit that Les Mis is the better book. I think I would get more out of Les Mis on a re-read, more depth, more intricacies, etc. This one is more just a page-turner of a story, once you get past the digressions about Parisian architecture. I'm glad I finally read this chunkster classic from my TBR shelf! And now that I‚Äòve read the source material, I wonder why anyone thought this would be a good story to adapt for kids?!
292`5`This was fabulous. I have never read it before. The translation felt alive. The book itself is intense. A historical novel written as a historical novel--interesting! I loved seeing more than one historical period blended.
293`2`This would be my advice to Victor Hugo. If I had a time machine I would travel to a time just before he published this book, and give him an intervention. Dear Mr. Hugo,Firstly, may I say that I am a big fan of your future work, Le Miserables. And because of that, I cannot accept The Hunchback of Notre Dame as you have written it. If it were written by a different author, I would dismiss this as a three star novel, not terrible, but not a book I would read again if I had the chance. But in the future you will write a masterpiece, and so I rate this a two star novel, for failed potential.The plot is magnificent. But you have written this story all wrong. You destroyed the mysteries- Esmerelda's enemy, and her mother, by revealing the information too soon, and not using the early revelation to create tension and anticipation in the reader to be sustained throughout the story. Leave things unexplained- it gives you the chance to surprise us later on. Readers love to be surprised. You made the story less fun to read, by woefully neglecting Esmerelda and Quasimodo (the only sympathetic characters) perspectives. By all means, give us glimpses of the perspective of the villainous archdeacon (no, DON'T! Frankly his perspective disturbed me greatly), use Gringoire's perspective to introduce the book, and show how the mysterious Esmerelda looks to a stranger, give Jehan a few lines to add some wit. But all of that should come to less than a quarter of the book. YOU CREATED TWO AMAZING, SYMPATHETIC, UNIQUE CHARACTERS. GIVE THEM THE VOICE THEY DESERVE! I admire your story, but the story telling in this novel is incredibly disappointing. I sincerely wish you could have a do-over, rewrite this story with the wisdom and genius you will accumulate by the time you write Le Miserables. Thankyou for listening,Goodbye from,An admirer and well-wisher, a friend.
294`3`Thoroughly depressing.
295`5`Tragic Quasimodo, hidden for his own protection,( for fear people would think his defects would label him a monster) in the heights of the belfry spires of the church of Notre Dame, longs for a life, just like anyone else. But his grotesque appearance and lack of social skills are a few of many setbacks that prevent him from ever seeing the complete light of day, and being accepted.He falls in love with bad girl Esmerelda from afar and is determined to save her from her life of sin and degradation. But the best laid plans go astray, and other nefarious creatures far more grotesque have worse plans in store for her.Would she be better off with the hunchback or the real deviant, who straps the cripple to a wheel in the square and humiliates him and whips him within an inch of his life? Who is the real monster here?
296`3`Un cl√°sico escrito por V√≠ctor Hugo con el plus de mi ilustrador favorito Benjamin Lacombe. El libro al principio me confundi√≥ porque no entend√≠a que personaje est√°bamos siguiendo, no entend√≠a a donde nos llevaba cada pagina, ni de quien era la historia que intentaba narrar. Ya a la mitad finalmente salen Esmeralda y Quasimodo, pero de manera muy superficial, s√© que no es Disney, pero esperaba que ellos tuvieran un papel mas importante.Lo malo de este libro a mi parecer y no dudo que sea una joya, es que cuando sent√≠a que ya me estaba enganchando con la historia, de repente hablaba de otras cosas, como la arquitectura y no se que tantas cosas mas que me terminaban aburriendo mucho y as√≠ termine el primer libro de golpe sin ning√∫n emoci√≥n de desear leer el que sigue. Aunque lo comprare porque los dibujos son hermosos.
297`null`Unfortunately, this is going to be a DNF. Usually, if I can‚Äôt see a book showing promise of improvement by a third of the way through, I give it up as lost. This one had an over-abundance of language, flippancy towards Christianity‚Äîand, by reflection, God‚Äîand Quasimodo was written as something less than human, just because his exterior was deformed. If someone who has finished the book would like to tell me whether that last count ever improves, I might consider giving it another go. Victor Hugo was a brilliant writer, but, it seems, hadn‚Äôt yet learned the art of focusing his storytelling talents at the time of writing this book.
298`3`Upon completion of this novel, I wondered why in the world Disney decided to adapt this (completely different, mind you). Diving into this right after Les Mis was a mistake, The Hunchback is an epic in it's own right, but I couldn't help but compare and feel let down.I believe my translation for Les Mis was much better-- although I did see Hugo's own style in the two. I love it-- I really do believe he's an excellent writer and author; but Hunchback was a little too dark and dreary-- I could not find the beauty. Esmerelda's ignorance and stupidity was too glaring and bothersome for me to overlook.She is nothing compared to Fantine-- Fantine! Poor Fantine! Both fell for the handsome man and paid dearly.The scene with Esmerelda and her mother was heart-wrenching-- but I knew that was coming as soon as the situation was introduced. Another interesting parallel to Les Mis, with Fantine and Cosette. And now the priest: Lord have mercy on his soul. Very intense and horrifying character, truthfully. These are the men to be weary of.Quasimodo was quite alright-- it's wrong of those who adapt this story and make him mentally challenged as well: he is not.He knows how he is and wishes he wasn't.But above all, the poet was my favorite-- and the goat. 
299`4`Very descriptive, I thought it was a bit boring in the beginning but it really picked up in the middle.¬† Of the classics this was up there with the best.¬† A must read for anyone who loves classic¬†descriptive literature.¬† I cried at the end.¬†¬†See full review herehttps://gszengarden.wixsite.com/mylit...
300`5`Victor Hugo describes much more than 15-th century parisian architecture with THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, he describes emotions as they pertain to the soul. Using a soldier, a priest, an artist, a hunchback, a dancing gypsy, a woman imprisoned, a band of vagabonds and citizens of conformance populating the city of Paris as symbols for human emotions and the church of Notre Dame to represent the soul--HUGO weaves a story of brilliant imagination and subtance. This is a masterpiece.
301`4`Victor Hugo has a way with words. I loved the details he used for all of the architecture and the amazing descriptions. If I wasn't dying to go to France before this book, I'm more than ready now! Two words: Flying Buttresses. I've always loved the Disney Film of Hunchback, and this just made my love even stronger. I even have a strange likeness for Claude Frollo. (Is it weird that I now find the Hellfire sequence beautiful?) What can I say? I love a good crazy person, and Claude Frollo is definitely that. He is flawed and slightly creepy. But he had to take care of his younger brother and he took in Quasi, and truth he's more than a middle aged man obsessed with a teenager. I can't exactly pin point why I liked him. But I did.Esmeralda and Phoebus were no where near the top of my favorite character list. Esmeralda was so naive and put all her faith in a man who couldn't even learn her name. Which by the way, I think I laughed for ten minutes over. Every time he referred to her as Similar, I died. And then he tried to spin at her name is just so beautiful that he gets lost in it. Well done, sir, well done. Me = dying of laughter. Point Disney for making me love Esmeralda and Phoebus as characters.And now on to Quasimodo. Quasi was my favorite part of the entire novel. In my opinion he did not have nearly enough screen time. His relationship with the bells was perfect and exquisite. He put so much love into them, and every time he was ringing them and listening to them you could feel the joy they brought him. I did love his relationships with all of the other characters.Shout out to Gringoire, my third favorite, beneath Quasi and Frollo. Fourth, of course, would be Djali the goat. And Gringoire's weird obsession with Djali was the best. At least someone was looking out for Djali!The ending was flawless and some of my favorite literature. I feel like this will take a couple reads for me to fully comprehend how fabulous this book is. I think I'm only at the tip of the iceberg. There were many sections that jumped around and wove together and were so intricate that I'm dying to go back and see them all come together. (Thank goodness I had the audiobook because the gentleman's French was much better than mine would be!)
302`2`Victor Hugo is the man, there is no doubt about that. This book was extremely long and dry and miserable. If you happen to find a 40 page shortened version out there, read that one!
303`4`Victor Hugo no me decepciona
304`4`Victor Hugo tiene una manera √∫nica de narrar y de describir todo, la forma en que aborda la primera parte de la historia me encant√≥. Conocer a Esmeralda, a Quasimodo y a Frodo de esta manera fue fascinante, adem√°s de poder ver sus or√≠genes y explorar m√°s los personajes.La parte que no me gust√≥ fue que las descripciones son taaan detalladas que incluso Victor Hugo utiliza DOS cap√≠tulos para narrarnos Notre Dame y Par√≠s, adem√°s de comparar la ciudad de 1400 con la de 1800 (la √©poca que √©l vivi√≥) llegando al punto de enumerarnos las puertas de la Sorbona (¬°S√ç, LAS PUERTAS!), por esa raz√≥n se me hizo un poco tedioso.A pesar de eso, la historia me lleg√≥ muy profundo al coraz√≥n, me emocion√© y me conmovi√≥ demasiado, espero leer muy pronto la segunda parte.
305`4`Victor Hugo ties in the destinies of a handful people in Paris in the late fifteenth century so cleverly and atmospheric together in a tragedy, that it belongs to the most known dramas‚Äô in European literature. The significance of this work is based on the psychological archetypes that Hugo portrays as tragic characters. The author characterized the underlying society with particular destinies and psychographics. Church, nobility, poets and criminality of the contemporary Paris, which are here represented by individual fates, are leading to genre picture of this time. I personally think that Hugo's excellent narrative style and ability to act are complex and intelligent.
306`5`Victor Hugo's Les Mis√©rables is one of my all-time favourite novels and so it's odd that I've never read any of his other books. In order to fill in the gaps in my reading, I've decided to read at least one classic a month this year and am so glad I started with The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Wow, wow... WOW! What a freaking good story! It's not quite as good as Les Mis but it's still incredible. At times Hugo can be long-winded and I could have thrown the Kindle across the room when he rambled on for 50 or so pages describing Notre Dame and the view from there. However, as I didn't fancy breaking the Kindle and having to buy a new one, I reined myself in and plowed through it. (Maybe physical books ARE better than e-books in this case?!). After that section, thankfully near the beginning, the book was very enjoyable and gripping. But damn! It will break your heart! Still, Hugo's wit is prevalent throughout and I found myself chuckling several times, even though the story is so tragic. I'm so glad I finally got around to reading this.
307`5`Victor Hugo‚Äôs first real novel, written under duress from his publisher!! Nevertheless, he manages to render a dark environment joyous, almost funny at times. For me, the protagonist is not Quasimodo but Esmeralda. It‚Äôs her inner and outer struggles we have access to the most. As usual, Victor Hugo portrayed them realistically, neither all good nor all bad, thus humane and credible. Even Gringoire and Claude are portrayed that way, as human beings subjected to primal instincts and humane spirituality.In this novel Victor Hugo attacks Prejudice and Justice simultaneously: the deaf judge, judging a deaf defendant; and the judgment of Esmeralda‚Äôs goat!!!Quasimodo‚Äôs inner conflict over Claude at the end is deeply moving. Claude brought him up as father, then broke his heart by trying to harm Esmeralda. Ultimately, Quasimodo‚Äôs spirituality wins over his animal-like devotion to Claude...The final scene where we discover the skeleton of Quasimodo next to Esmeralda brought me to tears.
308`4`Victor Hugo‚Äôs love letter to the great cathedral of Paris is, like many love letters, beautiful and poignant, sad and touching, frustrating and in need of an editor.When I first read this book in high school, as part of my youthful efforts to consume anything and everything classified as horror, I was surprised at how dark Norte Dame was, especially for a classic novel. With a few more classics ‚Äì and a couple more decades ‚Äì under my belt, I still see the darkness but found much more compelling Hugo‚Äôs exploration of love and the narrow line between it and obsession, how it can provide life and strength on the one hand, or can curdle into lust or desperation and lead to suffering and death on the other.Like Hugo‚Äôs longer, more magisterial Les Mis, Norte Dame has its share of unnecessary sermonizing, whole chapters (especially describing the view of Paris from the cathedral and the exposition on the history of architecture) being skimmable. But also like Les Mis, Hugo unfolds an unforgettable story with poetic and evocative prose that more than justifies its place in the canon of classic literature.He also creates one of literature‚Äôs most despicable and loathesome villains, the obsessive and scheming Archdeacon Jean Claude Rollo, who does far more preying than praying as he spins his web and ensnares the na√Øve Esmeralda.On the other side, another of literature‚Äôs most memorable characters is the tragic Quasimodo, alteranately mocked and despised, yet the only person who demonstrates a healthy understanding of how to love another. His love for Esmeralda was always doomed to be unrequited, but he nevertheless sacrifices himself for her, shelters her and actually strives to meet her needs. In what is no doubt an intentional irony, the deaf man is the only character who listens to her.That‚Äôs much more than can be said for the oblivious Gringoire ‚Äì whose pathetic life Esmeralda nevertheless saves, a good deed for which she is not unpunished ‚Äì and the rakish Phoebus, who does not deserve Esmeralda‚Äôs ‚Äì or anyone else‚Äôs ‚Äì affection.Unfortunately, for as much as is good about Norte Dame ‚Äì including, it must be said, the beautiful chapter describing the cathedral itself, which has been much quoted in the wake of the fire that devastated it this spring ‚Äì it has two major flaws that left me wishing for better.First is the character of Esmeralda, whose na√Øvet√© is fatal, both to the character and to my enjoyment of the conclusion of the novel. How could a girl raised by Roma ‚Äì and therefore likely well aware of the prejudices held against her people by populations more than willing to burn them as witches or drive them out of their cities ‚Äì be so consistently stupid by the age of 16? Consistently letting her goat do tricks that get her branded as a witch is bad enough, but her obsession with Phoebus in the final chapters had me rolling my eyes.Second is the series of events concerning Esmeralda and her long lost mother. The coincidences pile up until the reader‚Äôs suspension of belief cracks under their weight. These complaints, in addition to the usual passel of Hugoesque digressions, keep this from being a flawless novel, but Norte Dame is still an excellent one, gorgeous and horrifying, stately and mesmerizing, poignant and electrifying. As a novel, it‚Äôs a classic. As a love letter, it‚Äôs one of a kind.
309`3`Was this a just fairy tale? I mean a darker fairy tale, where the frog didn‚Äôt get kissed, and instead ran away with the goat? (That‚Äôs a little of a spoiler). No, seriously, Hugo put a lot of time into researching this Paris of 1482, and this Cathedral, but he held off writing it until time became desperate, this according to Andre Maurois in the afterword. Then, he spent weeks locked in a room, wearing a head-to-toe sweater that he couldn‚Äôt leave the house in, and crunched out the actual text. So, there is a lot of Hugo‚Äôs outsized ego here, in all its, well, charm maybe. Actually he had a lot of fun with the text, which is full of expansive humor, long-winded ideas only Hugo appreciate, and a complete panoramic of Paris from the top of the Cathedral, recreated from his research and likely freely filled-in with details he didn‚Äôt know or wanted; in any case, the medieval city and this building are both very much there. I read this with a group on Litsy over 8 weeks, in separate short burst with lots of in-app discussion between. The timing was in response to the tragic fire this past May. It really felt light read for such a famous classic. But then these characters are embedded in my head. I now feel I know Quasimodo and his keeper, the dark sorcerer archdeacon Claude Frollo of the Notre-Dame cathedral; Esmeralda and her anti-hero, the penniless philosopher Pierre Gringoire, and few other characters too, particularly Esmeralda's remarkable little goat, Djali.My take is that this feels like eastern fairy tale, something maybe out of 1001 Nights, that was transported to medieval Paris, and then wrapped in light philosophizing lessons of sorts on love, beauty, corruption, mobs, fate, bad kings and fatally flawed presumed-guilty-driven legal systems. (Here justice isn't just blind, but also deaf.) Perhaps he might have had a recent failed revolution in mind, and a disheartening restoration. Maurois thinks it's a dark work and certainly the end is darker than a reader who doesn't know might expect. But the humor and fun touches are mostly what I have mind when I think about it.While I did enjoy reading and discussing this, the book never really wowed me.

310`4`We know The Hunchback of Notre-Dame is Victor Hugo's classic masterpiece for a reason, but it did take me a while to understand why. It starts slowly, with several treatises embedded in the text. Hugo is particularly inflamed by the failure to maintain the Medieval architectural structures of France. In this regard, the Cathedral is itself a major character in his novel.As for the story, it is a romantic tale of love, abuse of power, political and religious corruption, the moral state of humanity, the injustice of justice, the futility of love, the inability of man to see beyond the surface and love for what is beneath, and the fleeting effects of beauty on life. The only character who truly loves is the misshapen Quasimodo, who loves Esmeralda more than self. Because he has been conditioned to think himself beyond being loved by anyone, he takes all of his affections and heaps them upon the object of his desires without any expectation of any return.Frollo the Archdeacon is a malevolent character, but this is tempered by what we know about him prior to his falling for Esmerelda's charms. It is he who has saved Quasimodo when no one else would have even considered doing so, and he has raised and cared for his worthless brother past all duty and obligation. At the same time, he is the poster child for those who lament "if I can't have you, no one can." To the bitter end, I hoped that his better nature would win out, but even in the face of knowing his soul was at stake, he persisted in feeding his evil character.By its conclusion, the story has become a tragedy of great proportions. I was reminded of the final lines of Romeo and Juliet in which the Prince laments "all are punished." Goodness does not win any quarter for Esmeralda, who dies piteously and the only kindness given her mother is that she expires before she can see her daughter hanged. Both Frollos get what is coming to them and Quasimodo suffers the fate he chooses in the absence of saving his love. Only Djali can be said to have a happy end, Gringoire will doubtless make him a fine master.Had someone asked me if I knew this story, I would have said "yes". I would have been wrong. I had many misconceptions about both the plot and the themes Hugo addressed. It is apparent why this story has survived time and still has impact and meaning for a modern audience: Love is often still unrequited for the wrong reasons; we still fail to see the quality in someone who presents an ugly face and make too much of those who are only pleasing outwardly; there is still great political corruption that feeds the pockets of those at the top and cares nothing for the everyday man; mobs still whip themselves into fury and reap havoc upon the wrong objects; and injustice can be found in every community and every system.
311`5`We start above Paris in 1482 and then zero in on the Palais de Justice, through the windows, into an unruly mob of students, over the failure of a play, and finally come to rest on the glaring eye of Quasimodo, framed with Victor Hugo's incomparable sense of drama.From then on, the action is gripping. The reverse Frankenstein Quasimodo is the soul of the book. (Well, Notre Dame itself is the soul, but Quasimodo is its homunculus. Scenes of him crawling all over the facade of the church are the book's best visuals.) The damned Archdeacon Claude Frollo is the most dastardly monk since The Monk. The beautiful moron Esmeralda is the most in distress of all damsels. This is the only book I know of that can give the great Wuthering Heights a run for its money in terms of sheer melodramatic spectacle. There's no emotion too intense for Victor Hugo.Gripping the action is, but not relentless. Hugo has the greatest zoom lens in literature, as in that virtuoso opening, and he'll zoom back out several times. Sometimes the zoom happens abruptly, interrupting the action. Toward the end, right in the middle of a battle scene as good as his famous Barricades fight from Les Mis√©rables, he switches to a lengthy discussion of state finances; I see what he's up to, but it's maddening.Only Hugo can give you a perfect birds-eye view of Middle Ages Paris; only he can map its sewer system, as he does - also famously, but less loved - in Les Mis√©rables. That's wonderful, but best read on a plane when you can't be distracted by the urge to check your email. He requires your patience. The entire Book Five of Notre-Dame de Paris, added for the second edition (he's lying about "losing" it), is brutal; skim the first chapter, but when you get to "This Will Kill That" and your eyes start glazing over, you can skip the rest. It's hella repetitive. The point is that the printing press will kill the building, because we can now communicate permanently and more cheaply via books. Fine.The word ANAKH, carved into the wall of Notre-Dame, hangs over the book. It means fate, necessity, force. It carries an aura of doom - torture is among its meanings. There's hardly a moment here when someone (usually Esmeralda) isn't about to be hanged. Torture is a constant presence. ANAKH is a wonderfully Romantic word, and this is a Romantic book, with all the high intensity - and disregard for reality - that Romantic books bring with them. They aren't supposed to reflect real life. They're fables. You have to surrender to them, or you won't like them. I surrender.Les Mis√©rables is Hugo's masterpiece, but Notre-Dame de Paris (classy people call it that, not its Anglified title Hunchback of Notre-Dame, which Hugo was infuriated by) is much shorter - 600 pages to Les Mis's 1400+ - so it might be a good starter Hugo.Edition NotesI read a translation by Krailsheimer for Oxford World's Classics, after some research; I thought it was terrific. The intro is shit though - a plodding runthrough of the entire plot, like a ninth-grade book report, and a failed attempt to claim that the important part is the slow stuff, because Hugo's developing themes or whatever. That's bullshit. The important part is Quasimodo leaping around, and any attempt to prove otherwise is the work of a person who has forgotten how to enjoy a book.
312`3`Well I'll say this I will never watch the Disney film ever again after this. That film is nothing but a sugar cookie compared to this. Hunchback is a tragic story of lust interesting and relatable enough but this book's major problem is writing. The style of it's time does not hold up. Also trivia fact Victor Hugo wrote this to promote preservation of ancient architecture in France. However that would have made a great topic for a different book, all the architectural talk make the being of this book drag so much by the time we're introduced the Quasimoto I stopped caring.Hunchback deserves a modern day movie adaption that is true to the original Source material.Although why do I get the feeling at Disney still owns the film rights and instead of a dark accurate retelling we get a water down live action remake talking gargoyles and all.
313`3`Well that was peculiar.
314`4`Well, first and foremost, this is not a Disney movie!The title is a misnomer. The original French title is Notre Dame de Paris and the cathedral itself is the star of this show. The unfortunate hunchback is only in maybe a third of the scenes.I actually wept at the end of Hugo's Les Mis√©rables ...the book not the musical...so I was expecting the same level of brilliance and connection. It didn't happen. This story was sad and violent and just so terribly unfair, but the characters did not touch my heart the way Jean Valjean did. In fact, more than anything, I found myself cheering for Djali the goat! Yes, folks, there is a goat. As for most of the human characters...meh. Or as the goat would say, Meeeeeeeeeeh!Nevertheless, Hugo's detailed descriptions of his beloved city, the weird Fellini-esque Court of Miracles, and the cynical, verbose, always self-preserving Gringoire the starving poet, make this book worth reading.
315`4`Well, that was hurtful.Good, better than I thought it would be, but kind of hurtful.
316`4`Well. I knew the Disney version took liberties, but holy smokes, this novel isn't called Gothic for nothing. I'm still thinking about that final image - it's so pessimistic and poignant, showing both how cold and ruthless people can be, and how fragile and wrecked by emotion we ultimately are. Frollo, of course, is both things at once (which is part of what makes him such an effective character; he embodies this human incongruence in its darkest form). The book as a whole is such a diatribe against society and "man's inhumanity to man" (with little credence given to the possibility of redemption) that I had to investigate where it stood in Hugo's oeuvre. It didn't surprise me at all to learn that he wrote Hunchback in his late 20s, whereas Les Mis√©rables was published when he was 60. There's clearly a great deal of worldview development and accumulated wisdom that separates the two works. (Also, you can just tell that Hunchback is the work of a younger person. More sex and violence, somewhat less philosophizing. Ha. Though Hugo does wax poetic about architecture to his heart's content.) It's interesting to me how the whole drive of Les Mis is the characters' evolution - Valjean at the end of the novel is worlds apart from who he is at the beginning - whereas in Hunchback, none of the characters are allowed to change at all. Quasimodo, Esmeralda, Frollo, and Phoebus are all static, victims of either their natures, fate, or circumstance. I'm never partial to that kind of story. I prefer watching characters grow. Still, there's something fascinating about seeing this cast of tragic figures unwittingly orchestrate their collective demise, while the most callous person in the book escapes the chaos intact. I may not like the outcome, but the statement Hunchback makes is clear. Hugo obviously accomplished what he set out to do. Just... dang. I'm glad the guy managed to balance some of that bleakness with a (IMHO) more well-rounded take on the human condition later in life. 
317`5`What a tale!! I'm in shock.So much to say here, but I will just mention that Victor Hugo seems to have been a modern man stuck in an antiquated time, and, furthermore, he‚Äôd possessed an extraordinarily fascinating mind. Reading this in the wake of the recent fire in Notre-Dame was a really harrowing experience; oddly prophetic, it made everything feel 'close to home' and brought me closer to the tragedy. Having never seen Notre-Dame myself, this book brought the cathedral to life for me.Loved this book, tragic and sorrowful though it was.
318`5`What a wonderful book! ‚ô•This is a tragic history about love and it carries the meaning that interior beauty is what matters the most in the end. In addition to this, the story is much more about the cathedral of Notre Dame, its architecture and the splendid city of Paris than just about Quas√≠modo, the hunchback, itself. The hunchback of Notre Dame is a horrendous creature that scares people with his ugliness, but he is a beautiful and sincere soul. He does all he can to save the innocent and lovely gypsi, Esmeralda, from a nasty and crazy priest and from the ignorance of all the people that believed in witchcraft and in hanging people with no real proof.Although it may be not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea because it has a lot of description and historical facts, I loved it. I think the dark description of the scenarios, mainly Notre Dame Cathedral, of course, and the true historical facts about the Middle Age and the kings of France add some enchantment to this ficcion. The ending made me sad and, at the same time, angry about injustice, and I believe that was the exact point of the genius Victor Hugo in writing this amazing book!I highly recommend reading this book!
319`3`What happened to the beginning of this unabridged story!? For 300 pages, The Hunchback of Notre-Dame was scribed like a meandering storyline over a checkerboard, each square representing a chapter of the book. The few squares scribed directly by the line told fleeting, but essential parts of the story (about Quasimodo, Esmeralda, and Frollo). The more numerous squares adjacent to the scribed storyline told even less essential bits of the story. And, the majority of squares, several dozen chapters, were far removed from the storyline, and had almost nothing to do with the concluding thrust of action in the book. It's not that the story dawdled; its just that most chapters were simply irrevelant to the main characters for the greater part of 300 pages.I'm not declaring that the writing was no good. On the contrary, as you'll see below, the writing was detailed and powerful, and I record several favorite examples. This is my first encounter with Victor Hugo's literature, and the sweep of his writing clearly indicates that he is a master polyhistor. However, even after concluding the book, I felt that several dozen chapters--most at the beginning, but even some near the end--were completely unnecessary. That's a cocky, absurd statement from someone who can't write like Victor Hugo, but in this case it leads me to understand why there are several hundred versions of The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, and why most of those versions are abridged. In fact many versions are children's picture books, which capture the essential story, and excise chapters of the checkerboard that don't relate to the main three protagonists.I understand that Hugo had to provide deep background for the story. It was essential to describe Notre-Dame and important for the reader to understand the life and times of late-medeival Paris. It's important to envision the environment and atmosphere in which the action takes place. It's critical to see the characters' early actions to translate and understand the profundity of their actions later. Yes, this all makes sense. In fulfilling this background, however, Hugo spent the greater part of 300 pages following a minor character, Gringiore. Gringiore did not serve as a foil, or a fulcrum, or a window into the main characters. No, he's a bit character whose importance actually declines toward the end. We have tantalizingly few descriptions about, and even less spoken words from, the key players.I do enjoy classics--the timing it takes to develop; the word choice, the author's methodology; the subtlety, metaphor, and symbology that requires numerous re-readings to truly appreciate; the transcendence of the author's message or lesson. The last third of this book is the real classic. Oh, how I wish Hugo had focused early on Quasimodo, Frollo, and La Esmeralda, and never let go. These characters are fertile, anomolous, and peculiar enough for all the chapters of The Hunchback of Notre-Dame.There are some incredibly turbocharged chapters, some of which were written akin to tragic Romantic soliloquies. Particularly:- Book V, Ch II when Hugo rants about about how the written word has usurped architecture- Book VIII, Ch IV when Frollo declares his love- Book X, Ch I when Esmeralda meets her mother, and the mob attacks Notre-Dame There are other problems I had with the book, though. The translator provided 20 pages of footnotes. Footnotes usually provide key information for understanding deep background. These footnotes, however, often called attention to Hugo's repeated misuse of Spanish and Italian. They also provided reference or explanation for things that were obscure, not exceptionally pertinent, and that didn't help backstage the story (for example, telling the real name of a building that doesn't actually exist anymore, legal cannon from the twelfth century, and what isolated Parisian neighborhoods used to be called before they disappeared to history). The notes, overwhelmingly, are simple translations of Latin, without explanation of why or to what purpose Hugo was using a particular Latin phrase. This is wholly my own prejudice, I know, but I fear that over time, Hugo's footnotes will become more and more obscure without better translation. Similar to how I feel about John Updike's writing. Several hundred years from now, readers will miss the awesome amount of reference that Updike makes to current cultural idiosycrasies and Americana, and will eventually require several hundred footnotes per book. I also had a small problem with Hugo refering to us as 'the reader.' At one point he actually refers to 'this book' that he's writing. It just seemed to make the discourse between author and reader a bit too chatty. And, just too much Latin. I would have preferred the translator insert English into the body of the text, while providing footnotes that displayed and explained the author's original Latin. I read every footnote, and felt that it was too much. New words: escutcheon, breviary, pudendum, orpiment, woadQuotes: - "Oh how hollow science sounds when you dash against it in despair a head filled with passions." (p. 329)- "Grief like this never grows old. For a mother who has lost her child, it is always the first day. This pain never ages. It is useless that the colors of mourning fade. The heart remains black as ever." (p.338)- "Nobody had noticed in the gallery of the royal statues, immediately above the pointed arches of the entrance, a strange-looking spectator, who had till then been watching everything impassively, head so outstretched, visage so deformed that, except for his apparel, half red and half purple, he might have been taken for one of those stone monsters out or whose mouths the long gutters of the cathedral have for these six hundred years disgorged themselves." (p. 354)- "He ran through the fields until nightfall. This flight from nature, from life, from himself, from man, from God, from everything, lasted till evening. Sometimes he threw himself on his face on the earth and tore up the young corn with his fingers; at other moments he paused in some lone village street, and his thoughts were so unbearable that he grasped his head with both hands and tried to wrench it from his shoulders in order to dash it against the ground." (p. 360)- "The night was cold. The sky was covered with clouds, the large white masses of which, overlapping each other at the edges and being compressed at the corners, resembled the ice of a river that has broken up in winter. The crescent moon, embedded in those clouds, looked like a celestial ship surrounded by aerial sheets of ice." (p. 367)- "The round room was very spacious, but the tables were crammed so close together, and the customers so numerous, that all the contents of the tavern, men and women, benches and beer jugs, those who were drinking, those who were sleeping, those who were gambling, the able-bodied and the cripple, seemed to be tumbled together chaotically, with just as much order and harmony as a pile of oyster shells." (p. 407)
320`5`What has Disney ( and the famous french play) done to Hugo‚Äôs Notredam!!!!???This book exceeds all expectations! I have always dreaded reading for authors of the 1800‚Äôs, I kept them to when i grow ‚Äúold‚Äù. And here i am at 29, reading my first classic french book! I don‚Äôt regret that as surely I would not have enjoyed this book at a younger age!Hugo transports us to Paris; a city that breathes into every page of this marvelous book! At every corner and with every speech, Hugo reminds us that Paris is a character in this book as much as any other living one! And who better to portray the elegance of paris than Notre Dam? Hugo describes in a meticulous manner a fa√ßade that is beautifully molded by history and destroyed by man; amazing prose! Notre-Dame is beautiful despite being old and grey, full of monster statues and gothic; if you look into the details the church might not be a view to look at but when tken as a whole, it is just beautiful just like our protagonist Quasimodo! Hugo‚Äôs love for architecture is pretty evident all throughout the book! A chapter that begins with ‚ÄúThe book will kill the church‚Äù is a quote that starts 10 pages of insight into how architecture changed and its importance! Magnificent!Without spoiling much, this is a story of passion and love; a beautiful gypsy La Esmeralda captures the spiritual love of two of our characters and the physical love of another! And after that, the whole course of the book changes! Passion is destructive and love is, sometimes, stupid! I loved this book but i will not delve into details lest I ruin it! But this is a piece of literature that deserves devouring!
321`5`What makes a monster and what makes a man?In the afterword of my edition the film and musical productions are called a 'horror', but I have to disagree. I think it's interesting to compare the Disney film with the original book. Victor Hugo did not put Quasimodo in the title, the original title is Notre-Dame de Paris. Which makes a lot of sense: Quasimodo is actually very little in this book. I do wish we'd seen him more, because he is such an amazing character. But it's also what makes the Disney film and musical (from 2014) interesting: they do focus on Quasimodo and I think they did a great job. Quasimodo is the center and many scenes are added that aren't in the book, but they're always based on the book. Going to the feast of fools without permission, talking to the gargoyles, singing to the bells, wishing he were made of stone: it's all in the book! But usually just with one sentence. So that's why I love the film and musicals; they fill in the gaps, in a way that's actually very close to the book. There's also more of the monster vs man theme going on, which isn't as clear in the book because Frollo isn't as obviously evil. Because another thing I noticed is that Frollo is not as full of hate in the book. Don't get me wrong: he's evil, but he's more complicated in the book. He doesn't actually hate Quasimodo; I don't think we're ever told why he picks up Quasimodo and cares for him, but I do not think it's so he can become a servant. Frollo is such a creep but at the same time such an interesting character. He's torn between his feelings and his mind, his religion and what's actually happening around him. He's always been a very rational man, leading with his head and not his heart, and suppressing love and any passionate, powerful feelings for years. So when he sees Esmeralda and it brings up these strong emotions in him, he doesn't know how to deal with it and it completely absorbs him and takes his life over. He's awful and disgusting, but I loved reading about his internal struggles. Obsession is a big theme in The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. It's obvious that Frollo is obsessed with Esmeralda, but what about Esmeralda's 'love' for Phoebus? I think it's safe to say that Esmeralda has been lonely for a very long time: she misses her parents and she does not fit in very well with the other gypsies; she doesn't really see them as family. She only has her goat as a friend. The people of Paris know her name and she is famous for her dancing and beauty. I see her as a lonely girl who wanders and dances and sings, but dreams of more. So when she's rescued by the handsome Phoebus, obviously she falls in love with him. And even though there are multiple points in the novel where Esmeralda's naivety is proved, it surprised me that she stays in love with him even after all of those situations from which she could tell that he's a selfish dick. He does not care about her at all, he's rude and flirts with other girls, but it does not seem to matter to her. In fact, when she's hiding when the king has ordered his men to find and kill her, she blows up her cover to yell his name when he's near. That was so stupid, it was literally after that that she was killed. She gave up her life for a chance with Phoebus. Did she genuinely believe he loved her? Or was she so desperate to be loved that she just couldn't give up the idea? Was it really love for him that she had, this man that she barely knows? I think this was also a form of obsession. She so desperately wants to belong, to be saved and be loved that she clings to this idea of Phoebus and her together. When he rescued her and showed her what's it like to be cared for, she couldn't let it go. For the same reasons, Quasimodo couldn't let go of Esmeralda. When everyone was bullying him, Esmeralda showed him kindness. Esmeralda becomes an angel to him and he keeps coming back for her, in the same way that Esmeralda keeps coming back for Phoebus. But about Esmeralda... I'm not so sure about her kindness. I think she's very open and naive, and wants to share happiness with her dancing and singing. But I also feel like she's quite self centered (I mean yeah duh, she's 16). Quasimodo gives up his food for her, he sleeps on stones so she can sleep on a bed and well, he saved her life. But is she ever thankful for it? She doesn't really think about it, she isn't very grateful and to me it came across as 'uh yeah of course he's doing all this for me, why wouldn't he?'. And the way she just loses her mind when someone even mentions Phoebus... Yes she's 16, but her immaturity did get on my nerves a couple of times. She's fixated on beauty and doesn't seem to be able to see through Quasimodo's ugliness to see his kind heart or see through Phoebus' beauty to see his selfishness. That metaphor with the vases and flowers broke my heart. So this obviously isn't a very coherent 'review', but these are some thoughts I have that I wanted to share. I may write more later. This is probably my #1 favorite story, so I'd love to hear other people's thoughts!
322`2`What to say here? I'm disappointed. I'm not saying it's bad, no, I'm saying it's disappointing. can't remember the last time I read a book as if I'm sleepwalking. I felt like, the main story had somehow become a minor aspect of the book and the rest of the stuff the story needed in order to proceed was given the main focus. I mean, yes, we need various toppings when eating an ice cream but we are not gonna do it at the ratio of 10% of ice cream and 90% of toppings right? That's what happened here. All the characters are important for the development of the story but the importance given to them is not necessary at all. Basically for me, this 672 pages book became a beautiful and a sad story that was hidden by 450 pages of bollocks. it could've been 200 pages max and I would've loved it.
323`5`When I was a kid, being bullied in school, my favorite movie was Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame. So, when I heard that we were reading this in school, I was overjoyed!... Only to be horribly misled and heartbroken by the novel. But still, this book is special. The movie quotes, "What makes a monster, and what makes a man?" Well, that rings true in the novel, as well. While I was HORRIBLY heartbroken by this book, I was still fascinated by just how much love Quasimodo had for Esmeralda. As a kid, and all the way up to my young adult years, I was in love with the idea of being in love.And just because you're different, doesn't mean you're not worth being loved in return.
324`3`When I was in middle school, I'd watched and enjoyed the Disney animated version of the story, totally oblivious to how absolutely horribly Disney had "cleaned it up" for the children. Then one day, on the word of the day mailing list I'm subscribed to, one of the words had an example on its use pulled from the book. Just that one except was enough to totally floor me, I knew Disney really frelled with things, but I never remembered it being so extreme before. I had for some reason assumed the movie was more accurate than others because it was actually kinda dark for a Disney animation.This revelation in hand, I went and found myself an unabridged copy of the book to read. I had assumed that since Disney chopped it up so horribly and changed things so drastically, I couldn't trust anyone to edit the story down, and didn't know what I was getting in for. From the start, I was noticing tons of things that Disney either edited out all together or drastically changed. I do think that if I give it another read, I will consider picking up an abridged copy, just because all the detailed descriptions of Paris and its architecture was just a little bit more than I could happily handle. Between slogging through that, the actual storyline was good.The characters were interesting, it was easy to get frustrated with the ones you like because of the stupid mistakes they make, it's also easy to cheer with them if they manage something good. The book is dark, the ending sad, but I still highly recommend it. Don't be ashamed to grab the abridged version if you don't think you can handle chapters of nothing but geography and architecture in the city of Paris though, it was the only thing I regretted about reading the book.
325`4`When approaching and reading this fascinating narrative, the reader is well advised to try and forget the silly Walt Disney film based on the story. This work is far more finely wrought, more complex and subtle, more emotionally wrenching and profound than that ridiculous movie suggests. As with Les Miserables, attempts to dramatize such a long and multi-plotted work inevitably fall short and are best forgotten when one turns to the books themselves.Many historical personages are mentioned in this novel. It is not necessary to know who these people were, but it does enhance the verisimilitude of the narrative and adds to the interest. The work is after all an historical novel, and some knowledge of the times in France is helpful. The dedicated reader might want to review French history in 1482, during the reign of Louis XI, to get a flavor of what the story is about. Few authors have been able so evocatively to conjure a sense of place as Hugo‚Äôs late 15th century Paris (many places are very recognizable to today‚Äôs reader who has been to Paris and walked its streets). Paris is a primary character in this narrative, and at its center is its omphalos, the Cathedral of Notre Dame in all its shabby grandeur, its mouldering deterioration (Hugo‚Äôs description of the cathedral apparently did lead to its restoration later in the 19th century). Everything revolves around the building and its site, and it is an orienting and a brooding presence throughout the novel. The French title for this book is, of course, Notre-Dame de Paris.Hugo has long interpolated chapters in which the author speaks directly to the reader, commenting not only on the action to date but also digressing to speak more philosophically about human trends and human progress, as in a chapter where he discusses the gradual demise of the preeminence of architecture as the mode of human expression and teaching and the rise of literature as the printing press appeared. This transition and transformation was both the product of and also enabled the rise of the democratic and Enlightenment spirit as power and control shifted from the Church and the aristocracy to the populace. Some readers might be impatient with these interruptions; I found them fascinating not only as philosophical ruminations but as reflections of the ideas emerging and coalescing in the early 19th century, an example of the philosophy of ideas continually mutates and evolves. Hugo‚Äôs exquisite sense of pace and timing, alternating chapters in such a way that the reader cannot turn aside but submits to the author‚Äôs choice of topic and emotional tenor as the strands of the plot unravel one by one, enhances rather than detracts from the novel.The complex plot, which I will not attempt to summarize here, involves the gypsy girl Esmeraldo, the unworthy soldier whom she loves, Captain Phoebus, and the two men who love her, the complex and ultimately maleficent Archdeacon Claude Frollo and the deformed Notre Dame bellringer Quasimodo. Suffice it to say, almost everyone comes to a bad end.Hugo is capable of including almost unnoticed details throughout the course of the text that symbolically tie the narrative together. A single example is Esmeralda‚Äôs tiny embroidered infant shoe at the beginning of her life of joy and hope, and the buskin of torture that is the emblem of her fate and death. On the other hand, his control of dialogue, sometimes astute and skillful, can also falter badly. The love talk between Esmeralda and Phoebus sounds stereotyped and stilted, symptomatic of times in the narrative when I felt the tone was unconvincing. Many of his dialogues are weak, out of character for the individuals into whose mouths he puts them or unconvincing in the context of the immediate action.Psychologically he can be more astute, for example in the development of Frollo‚Äôs character, a case of asceticism trying to overcompensate for the attractiveness of sensuality. Why is sex always so demonized? Is it due to the apparent loss of control that it produces? Humankind has difficulty letting go, and yet letting go is what ultimately each of us must do, for that is what aging and death cause and require. It is no wonder that the French call orgasm ‚Äúla petite mort.‚Äù In Frollo, Hugo paints a picture of progressive and total alienation from the self, despair that utterly unhinges reason, the sickness unto death. Is Hugo‚Äôs depiction essential anti-clerical or can it be generalized beyond that? Certainly the latter.Hugo, in his descriptions and his dialogue, can be frenzied and impassioned, histrionic and wrenching. He can be psychological penetrating and astute, and he can be both subtle and moving. He can also sometimes be maudlin and almost silly, excessive in the detail and the imaginativeness of his descriptions of place, emotions, and behavior. At such times he runs the risk of losing the reader, of causing the reader to recoil from engagement with the narrative and to respond with skepticism. It is a fine line that he treads, and sometimes he steps over it, breaking the reader‚Äôs willing suspension of disbelief. Is this always the danger in Gothic historical romance novels? It need not be, I think, but the risk is real.The narrative is an exploration of love, love in all its varieties and dimensions, its tenderness and loveliness, its anguish and extremes and perversions. Each kind of love is personified in one of the story‚Äôs main characters, and it is interesting to see such a global emotion or impulse dissected, examined in one dimension or another. Is any character, however, complete? Does any contain all these dimensions within himself or herself in the way each of us truly does? Or does each character simply present himself or herself as a caricature in this novel, rather than as a rounded personality? Perhaps Claude Frollo is the most fully realized character, the character most psychologically complex, the character who develops most dramatically during the narrative.Perhaps even more than love, Hugo‚Äôs obsession is with Fate, the Anank√° he describes having seen written on an interior wall of Notre Dame. Writing at a time when his political hopes have been disappointed, he turns to the writing of literature to express his understanding of life, its twists and turns. His characters play out this theme, almost all tragically. In this novel, Hugo has woven a tale that is compelling, not a flawless work but one that engages the reader and is hard to forget.
326`1`While I loved Hugo's sense of tragic irony, and though his descriptive powers are amazing, I hated this book. And it wasn't even required reading. I picked it up because it came highly recommended by many, and I enjoyed similar novels. I didn't expect it to be like the Disney movie, of course, but I expected it to at least make sense. Characters fall in love with each other completely arbitrarily (even worse than in a Disney movie!) and do things that make absolutely no sense. Esmeralda became progressively more annoying whining about Phoebus all the time, even in the face of capture, torture, and death, as did Claude Frollo carrying on about Esmeralda. Add to that the overly long chapter about the layout of Paris, which was too much information to even absorb, and nearly killed my motivation to read the rest of the book. I grudgingly finished the book because I felt I had to know exactly how everything ended, but not really because I wanted to.
327`3`While reading this book I started to notice how little the Hunchback is in it. A Goodreads friend mentioned that this is why the title for it in France is actually "Our Lady of Paris". For some reason, English translations chose the the Hunchback for the title.If other books, movies, or TV shows named themselves based on a character that was involved as much as Quasimodo was in this story, here is what they would be called:Star Wars = ChewbaccaHarry Potter = Neville LongbottomThe Big Bang Theory = Howard WalowitzThe Shining = Danny Torrance Frozen = OlafLost = Smoke MonsterAll those characters are important to the stories, but they are hardly the main focus. While this is the case with this book, it is not necessarily a bad thing, just a thing to be aware of going in; you really don't get very much Quasimodo.After reading and loving Les Miserables, I had high hopes for this book. But, it was just okay. I am glad I read it and I did enjoy it a lot in a few parts, but most of it was a slog. Hugo spends the first 350 pages or so setting up the story, describing Paris at the time of the story, etc. I think many who try this would have a hard time staying interested. Also, and I hate to say this because I always want my books to be unabridged, but, you could probably abridge this to 150-200 pages and still get everything.Classics buffs, Hugo fans, hardcore historical fiction fans - step right up! Casual reader thinking about checking out some Hugo, step on over to Les Mis!
328`4`While reading, I was considering the merits of abridged versions of classical works, but at the end - FUCK.My only experience with this tale was Disney - I knew their version was rot-your-teeth, sugar coated but duuuuuuude.SPOILER ALERT:In the late 1400s, a priest is infatuated with a gypsy girl who is in love with a soldier who is a P.O.S. (except when compared with the priest then he comes out favorably). The soldier is about to get lucky with the gypsy girl when the priest intervenes and stabs him. The gypsy girl is arrested and sentenced to hang as a witch. The hunchback (saved and raised by the priest) is also infatuated with the gypsy girl - he at least respects her bubble and moreso seems to recognize her as a human being - and thus rescues her from the scaffold temporarily protecting her with the sanctuary of Notre Dame ('cept that's the priest's crib!). The gypsy ends up "escaping" the church to find her long-lost mother grieving in a self-inflicted, weather-exposed dungeon (prayer cell). The guard catches up with her - her mother's skull is bashed in while the gypsy hangs. The hunchback pushes the priest off the ramparts of Notre Dame then finds and cuddles up with the corpse of the gypsy, rotting together. The soldier survived and marries (fate worse than death for him).I wish I could call this a caricature, but that would imply that it's exaggerated - this is the depth of absurdity that society had reached and the descent continues.But apparently it's really about the importance of preserving architecture from earlier ages. Aye, aye Hugo.#drunkreview
329`3`While some parts were more interesting than others, I liked this book. I almost wish I hadn't seen the opera or heard the Disney soundtrack, because I'm sure I would've enjoyed it more. The final chapter in particular made me sigh with bitterness at fate's **Hugo's** cruel designs.
330`4`Who knows, maybe I'm one of the only people in existence who enjoy good long novels about buildings. But then, there are a lot of fans of Follet's Pillars of the Earth, so maybe not. Are people the thing? Or is it place? Or what happens when we start confusing a place with the persons within it?Notre-Dame is a misshapen monster with a lumpy heart and a lumpy head. Or wait, is that Quasimodo? Is Esmeralda a good-natured gypsy dancer or is the spine of Paris itself?Seen this way, the whole tragedy of Esmeralda's gross miscarriage of justice (or the BIG IDEA writ as architecture in Notre-Dame, Quasimodo) being the gross travesty of France's history, takes on a wickedly abusive satirical slant.Or, if you prefer, a blind, deaf, and dumb legal drama so obviously obtuse as to become a farce... or is it? No. It's firmly a tragedy. Witch-killers, inquisition, hungry mobs, vagabond guilds, and blithe royalty, clergy, poets, and tradesmen... well, it's a sad, sorry tragedy where everyone gets a trowel up the flue.Did I like?That's hard to say. I loved the architecture rambling bits, which, I might say, might be the least favorite bits of other people. The characters themselves were sometimes amusing but always writ larger than life. I like that sometimes, and I liked it here most of the time. But there were points at which the tale seemed to get derailed and the more subtle points that Hugo WANTED to make, satire-wise, were lost in the drench of pathos.Overall, a solid novel and it certainly doesn't fail to entertain, but I can't quite put it up there as an absolute classic. 
331`3`Wonderful story but man is it long winded! I personally don't need entire chapters devoted to describing every inch of architecture of Paris's buildings. I have read that victor Hugo was paid per word, so I'm sure that is why his works tend to be long. Nevertheless it is a great classic!
332`4`Wow I have finally finished reading this book which is been my hunchback for the past month.As expected Hugo is hard to read,I'm going to read some children's books to free my mind...
333`3`Wow! Disney absolutely massacred this book. I will never look at the movie the same way again. I'm weird, I kind of enjoy an unhappy ending and for that reason, I wanted to give the book a better rating, but so much of the book, at least half, was a long and tedious history of Paris and its architecture and art and culture. I just wanted the story for heaven's sake!
334`5`Written by Victor Hugo, who also brought us the wonderful classic Les Mis√©rables (which in some ways is very similar to this story; I noticed a sort of parallel between Inspector Javert and Claude Frollo), this large classic features deep characters, dark but important thematic elements and morality which isn't always so black-and-white. Until recently my only experience with The Hunchback of Notre Dame had been watching the 1990's Disney animated film on VHS as a kid, which was waaaay back in 2005, and my memory of it isn't so good, except that I remember being disappointed by the ending, in which Esmeralda inevitably doesn't love Quasimodo in spite of him being a kind person (I was eight years old; it hadn't occurred to me back then that life rarely works out that way), and feeling very sorry for poor Frollo in his eventual demise (god knows why; he was scary back then! Kids in my elementary school classes had nightmares about him!). I decided I should go back and re-experience the story, but this time I wanted to try reading the original book over the Disney film. The novel is considerably deeper; although the Disney film did try, and in all fairness did manage to capture some of the complex emotions and psychology behind the characters, as a film intended for children it left out many of the book's deeper moments and is radically different from the book in many respects. Quasimodo actually isn't a huge presence in the novel in spite of him being the titular character, which was a bit odd, but the book seems to be more about sharing a message than it is about the characters themselves. I can't say that I loved The Hunchback of Notre Dame as much as Les Mis√©rables, unfortunately. While it's still a great novel and undeniably well-written, The Hunchback of Notre Dame seems in its own weird way to be a commentary on Victor Hugo's perception of France's architecture and a historical/political glance back in time. The pacing and structure of the novel is also difficult to get used to. If you like linear plots with only a couple of characters, I wouldn't recommend it, but if you like stories that follow their own course at their own time, this one is a good choice. I do however recommend reading Les Mis√©rables first if you're new to the work of Victor Hugo. It's arguably his best novel but also gives readers a chance to get immersed in his writing style before moving onto his other books. 
335`4`Yay I finally finished! Once Victor shuts up about architecture and boring stuff over the first 100 pages, the book moves along at a relatively quick clip. There are still random asides here and there that drive me a little batty, but they're easy to skim over. I liked the ending a lot. I liked seeing which bits Disney had specifically picked out from the text. But my favorite was the snark that sometimes popped up in the writing. For example, this quote: "'Who's there?' called the scholar in the friendly tone of a famished dog disturbed over a bone." and this one: "The physician and the archdeacon then began one of those congratulatory prologues which, at that period, customarily introduced every conversation between scholars and which did not prevent them from most cordially hating one another. Moreover, it is the same today." HAHAHAHA nice. A++ Hugo. You go Vic Hugo. 
336`4`Yes it took me a pretty long time to read. But I'm so proud that I finished it because it was worth it. Quite different from the beloved Disney version but simply amazing. I specifically found the scene where Quasimodo declares "Sanctuary" from Notre Dame as bone chilling as the movie version of it.
337`4`You know how you hear that one retirement plan is to read the classics? Well, my retirement plan is to have finished the classics by then and stay hip. /:)I have decided I will go for the "slow food" type writing and dove into our 100 essential books collection.Started with this one. Amazing writing of course, I need to be re-educated in enjoying long phrases and description. Great book, heart wrenching at times but ... life is very seldom a fairy tale or a Hollywood movie
338`4`[ Every character is a either an idiot or an absolute-fucking-douchebag. And I just wanted to pull all my hair out every scene a la Quasimodo. And why did everyone die? And someone save me, I just wanted to read the novelized version of my favorite animation *sobs incoherently* (hide spoiler)]
339`3`[Ambos salvan a la gitana en diferentes ocasiones pero es a Pheobus a quien Esmeralda termina sobreadorando solo por su f√≠sico. Y a pesar de que estuvo mucho tiempo con Quasi nunca dejo de tenerle miedo o asco, o una mezcla de ambas y eso es muy triste porque Quasi, aunque algo bravo, es bueno mientras que el otro guey es un hdp. (hide spoiler)]
340`5`[He knows Esmeralda was condemned for his murder: he is alive, and he knows it was her but the priest he let enter in the bedroom where they were supposed to have sex; he knew the other one would watch it all!!!! Rah, how I hate him!! And how I'm frustrated with Esmeralda, who doesn't understand he is a coward!! (hide spoiler)]
341`4`[Quasimodo's court trial (hide spoiler)]
342`3`[Quicker than a flash of lightning the recluse had compared the two shoes, read the inscription on the parchment, and thrust close to the window bars her face, beaming with heavenly joy, crying:'My daughter! My daughter!''My mother!,' answered the gypsy-girl.Here all description fails us. (hide spoiler)]
343`4`[Though the ending had me in tears. Everybody got a bad ending. Esmeralda and her mom died just after they were reunited. Quasimodo died in Esmeralda's grave. Frollo got pushed off the roof of Notre Dame. (Thank God, the poor old creep was driving me crazy) And Phoebus got married. (I know. Poor Phoebus. He deserved much worse.) (hide spoiler)]
344`5`about time Victor Hugo wrote something half decent
345`4`classics, historical fiction 8.9This is an abridged copy and while it did seem like things were a bit rushed at times, it wasn't toooooo terrible. I enjoyed the story. Hugo is famous for taking his time. I've heard people often skip certain lengthy portions in Les Mis because of that. I expect those same people would skip portions of this one as well. Once you set the characters straight, you begin to develop strong feelings about them. Hugo leaves things for his readers to decide on and to infer and seems delighted to stop and chat about what those things are. I adored those bits. I was also impressed by the way he nonchalantly tied in humor with even the most serious of plot pieces. Sometimes he was poking fun at his own culture and other times, the jokes were timeless. I laughed out loud often. Far more often than I ever expected. He provides a creepiness that is both eery and disturbing. Drippy Paris comes to life and readers will find themselves chilled to the bone at times. Great book. I cannot wait to read more! Oct. 30, 2017-Nov. 8, 2017

347`5`i just finished an amazing novel. love ittt‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•
348`3`i think my favorite thing here is how much glee hugo takes in writing HISTORICAL FICTION; he tells us all about how much fun he's having! more fun than anyone he's writing, admittedly.
349`null`in case anyone was wondering, the entire reason i've been wanting to read this book is because of one (1) tumblr shitpost that showed up on my dashboard a few years ago.
350`5`listened to the audiobook narrated by Christopher Lee. Incredible.
351`4`null
352`3`ok... i'll be honest. i hated the first 150 pages and had i not been reading it for book club i would have abandoned it. about 300 pages in i started to think it was okay. around 400... i really liked it. at page 450 i couldn't put it down. i stayed up till 2am last night finishing it. so... is it worth the painful first half to get to the second half? now that i've done it... i would say so. victor hugo could have used a good editor. pages and pages of diatribes and descriptions that made me feel like pulling my hair out - but the story is chilling and wonderful. i understood after reading it why there are so many abridged versions. :) of course its a piece out of history... melodramatic and predictable... but one expects that. all in all... i felt satisfied going to bed last night having read such a great book. still... next time i read Hugo... i will be prepared for a big front end investment.
353`4`read with my 4th grade daughter! we both enjoyed the book even though it was very dark and sinister it was a page turner.
354`null`very beautifully written book, like miserable, and ah-Q (Lu-xun), I found it really hard to understand people's reaction to that specific period of time
355`3`why Victor Hugo just Writes sad and miserable stories ?

357`4`‚ÄúGod helps the outcasts.‚Äù
358`5`‚ÄúHomo homini monstrum.‚ÄùWhen I was fourteen years old, I decided to read this book, because I loved the Disney movie and I thought it was about time to find out more about the original story. At first I was very excited, but soon Hugo's long descriptions put me off and I didn't manage to finish it. Six years later, I found myself reading the book again and actually enjoying it this time, maybe due to the fact that I am now a more patient reader and I wasn't so easily discouraged by the extended portraiture of medieval Paris. It's true that modern novelists, more often than not, prefer to focus on the plot rather than give a detailed description of the surroundings, but that wasn't always the case. Classic novels are usually more slow paced and the authors tend to concentrate on portraying the society that surrounds their heroes. In my opinion, they tried to educate their readers through their stories, not only to entertain them. So if you are looking for sheer entertainment, you should pick the Hunger Games and not this book (don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the Hunger Games). While reading The Hunchback of Notre-Dame you will come across a vast amount of information about medieval times, about how society suffered from prejudice and fear and how the judicial system controlled by the king and the church only managed to make things worse. It's not ‚ÄúLes Miserables‚Äù, but Hugo manages to create characters tormented by everything wrong in their times in this book as well; Esmeralda is accused of being a witch only because she is a gypsy, Quasimodo is shunned by everyone due to his deformity, and Frollo, having grown up in a deeply theocratic and conservative society, is terrified in the face of lust and passion- feelings so deeply connected with the human nature but which were also considered great sins. That belief is what led him to his downfall.When it comes to the characters most of them are well built and realistic, with the exception of Esmeralda. The only thing we really get to know about her is that she is extremely beautiful- apart from that she spends her time dancing or crying or mumbling Phoebus's name. She was such a disappointment, maybe because I was expecting her to be more like the quick witted and fiery Esmeralda from the Disney movie. It's true that she is only sixteen in the book, but still her naivety and blindness to what was really going on made me want to slap her. Frollo, on the other hand, although supposedly a bad guy, is actually one of the most complicated and troubled characters I've ever came across, and I couldn't help but sympathise with him. After years of trying to distance himself from the human world, lost into his big books, suppressing his emotions he is a bomb ready to explode- and this is exactly what happens when he sets eyes on Esmeralda. She is not only a woman to him, she is the incarnation of all his repressed needs and desires and this is why he becomes so obsessed with her and violent.All in all,it is a great book, heartbreaking and shocking, as it captures perfectly what a human being is capable of doing when desire takes control. Lust-and not love- destroyed Frollo, but the same applies to Quasimodo, Esmeralda (her obsession with Phoebus led her to some kind of apathy and made her fate inevitable), even Frollo's younger brother, a funny lad who never learnt the importance of putting reason before the gratification of every desire.
359`4`‚ÄúSo, kind brother, you refuse me a sol parisis to go and buy a crust from the baker?‚ÄúQui non laborat non manducet.‚Äù (He who does not work, let him not eat.)At this reply from the immovable archdeacon, Jehan hid his face in hins hands, like a woman sobbing, and exclaimed with an expression of despair: OœÑoœÑoœÑoœÑoœÑoœÑ!‚Äù‚ÄúWhat does that mean, monsieur?‚Äù asked Claude, surprised by this outburst.‚ÄúWhat? Well,‚Äù said the student, raising two insolent eyes to Claude into which he had just stuck his firsts so as to make them look red from weeping, ‚Äúit‚Äôs Greek! It‚Äôs an anapaest from Aeschylus which perfectly expresses grief.‚ÄùIn short:Hugo created a funny and sad read, but unfortunately, his characters lack some depth.In long:After finishing Les Mis√©rables, I wasn‚Äôt ready to let Hugo go. I needed more of his detailed, clever writing and so I picked up: Notre-Dame de Paris.Notre-Dame de Paris is funny and sad. It‚Äôs imaginative and yet predictable, and in the end, it felt like there is something amiss. And then it dawned on me: It‚Äôs too short. Simply too short.In Les Mis the characters have room to evolve, to suffer and to smile, but in Notre-Dame de Paris the characters remain two-dimensional. It‚Äôs such a shame because the characters Hugo created have so much potential. For a long time, for example, I haven‚Äôt encountered such cheeky characters. I laughed out loud a couple of times at their witts. but at the same time, the characters lacked some depth. They each have a story which is only slightly brushed upon, and thus remains hidden right in front of the readers‚Äô eyes. But I want to know more about La Esmeralda or Gringoire, or Jehan.All the same, the story is highly imaginative, enjoyable, and heart-breaking‚Äîbut it is not the story of Quasimodo. I don‚Äôt know why the book is often referred to as ‚ÄúThe Hunchback of Notre-Dame‚Äù; maybe because Quasimodo is the most iconic figure in the text. Nevertheless, he is not the main protagonist of this story. It‚Äôs Paris, including its architecture and its people:‚ÄúAdmirable, however, as the Paris of the present day appears to you, build up and put together again in imagination the Paris of the fifteenth century; look at the light through that surprising host of steeples, towers, and belfries; pour forth amid the immense city, break against the points of its islands, compress within the arches of the bridges, the current of the Seine, with its large patches of green and yellow, more changeable than a serpent‚Äôs skin; define clearly the Gothic profile of this old Paris upon an horizon of azure, make its contour float in a wintry fog which clings to its innumerable chimneys; drown it in deep night, and observe the extraordinary play of darkness and light in this sombre labyrinth of buildings; throw into it a ray of moonlight, which shall show its faint outline and cause the huge heads of the towers to stand forth from amid the mist; or revert to that dark picture, touch up with shade the thousand acute angles of the spires and gables, and make them stand out, more jagged than a shark‚Äôs jaw, upon the copper-coloured sky of evening. Now compare the two.‚ÄùAll in all, I can only add that the translation provided by John Sturrock reads beautifully as it preserves not only the ideas but also the beauty of Hugo‚Äôs prose:‚ÄúWhen they tried to release him from the skeleton he was embracing, he crumbled into dust.‚Äù
360`4`‚Äú‚Ä¶ his whole person was a grimace. A huge head, bristling with red hair; between his shoulders an enormous hump, a counterpart perceptible in front; a system of thighs and legs so strangely astray that they could touch each other only at the knees, and, viewed from the front, resembled the crescents of two scythes joined by the handles; large feet, monstrous hands; and, with all this deformity, an indescribable and redoubtable air of vigor, agility, and courage, ‚Äî strange exception to the eternal rule which wills that force as well as beauty shall be the result of harmony... ‚ÄòTis Quasimodo, the bellringer, the hunchback of Notre-Dame!‚Äô... ‚Äî Victor HugoNotre-Dame de ParisOf the caveats for enjoying classical literature, there should be one admonition to the reader: be willing to embrace its narrative context, and appreciate that it was written for the folly of its time. And so under Victor Hugo, the epoch tale of .Notre-Dame de Paris. (The Hunchback of Notre Dame), there is revealed a tragedy with timbre, anxiety, an array of fanatical superstitions, foremost among them the sobering empyrean prejudices that arguably define France in the 15th century. Its people, their customs and dress, the architecture and infrastructure, the language, and their basic struggles for simple justice, despite a prevailing capacity for villainy from both its spiritual and judicial quarters, are all scrutinized through this 19th century story teller; a vision endeavoring to enhance, albeit strenuously protracted at times, this Gothic / Romantic adventure serving as an instrument of FATE. Pierre Gringoire at the Cour des Miracles Illustration by Gustave Dor√© for the 1860 editionFirst published in January 1831, .Notre-Dame de Paris. has produced a progeny of adaptations, both frivolous and inspired (15 films, 2 operas, 2 ballets, and 3 musicals), but in doing so, has also re-calibrated its relevant historic circumstance; transforming its characters temperaments, and eschewing many dramatic secondary story arcs so as to be more agreeable to the modern day. These transliterations sadly deflate much of its emotional angst, and thus have been softened for younger ages more innocent or gladdened for older sensibilities more delicate. The result, a loss of its true Gothic / Romantic and tragic interpretation. In Hugo's novel, there is no beacon of grace, or veiled attempt to shine a redeeming or hopeful light on histories Dark Ages. It was an era that promoted ignorance as an armor and progress as sorcery; when there were no entertainment ratings obliged to satisfy media censors. Instead, Hugo's connotations of the Beautiful and the Grotesque artfully remained a metaphor in focus and delivery.What is repeatedly lost in rendition is its centrum, the cathedral of Notre-Dame itself (recall the original title, .Notre-Dame de Paris., reflected its Gothic genre until its first marketing transformation 3 years later, changing to the more popular "Hunchback" by an English translator, and more befitting a Romance genre). Hugo's original goal was to enlighten his contemporaries of the value of Gothic architecture, thus, it seemed congruous that his Grand Opus had as its cynosure a majestic cathedral; tall, imposing, solid, reverent, and with its soul animated by its deformed bell-ringer. And despite later becoming the title character, Quasimodo was more an understated variable in this singular chapter of the religious monuments legacy. Indeed, his formal introduction came only after Hugo's protracted Third Book treatise about the "majestic and sublime edifice" and its panoramic view above Paris. In fact, the misanthropic bell ringer was decidedly placed in the context as being part of Notre-Dame's architecture; becoming one of the most brilliantly written character portrayals in classical literature. It is in this, the Fourth Book chapter IMMANIS PECORIS CUSTOS, IMMANIOR IPSE where Quasimodo's quality is revealed as the epoch metaphor for the transient nature of the beautiful and the grotesque.And while Quasimodo remains distinguished as that signature figure ‚Äî the impartial champion against the powerful ‚Äî the remaining ensemble of characters: Esmeralda, Claude Frollo, Captain Phoebus, Clopin Trouillefou, and that singularly humorous figure, Pierre Gringoire, all provide an intense study, each immersed in their individual conflicts with greed and compassion. And then in turn, each attends to the reader‚Äôs sympathy, strangling the heart with their unique tragedies. La Esmeralda from Notre Dame de Paris, By Gustave Brion (1824-1877)It is, however, the fate of 16-year-old Esmeralda, her innocence and vulnerability seen through so many eyes, both compassionate and bigoted, that the epoch becomes the most wrenching. It becomes drama filled the unqualified heroics, lusting romance, and tragedy born of injustice; all of which taking place under the dark profile of the twin-towered cathedral, creating a stage for her brutal execution amid the horrific collateral damage inflicted on the entire troupe; the inescapable crush of flesh and bone upon its stone fa√ßade. Notre-Dame oversees the executions of body and soul. Drawn portrait of Victor Hugo by Auguste Rodin (1885).Ôªø In the PREFACE of .Notre-Dame de Paris., the author specifically remarked on a word found engraved in the stone of an "obscure nook of one of the towers. ". It was "upon this word" that his book took its foundation. That there, in this cathedral, most distinguised for its antiquity and architectural inspirations, that the eternal statement of a civilization, a message solid and unmovable, regaled in its moral struggles with faith, justice, and definitions of beauty as being subordinate to the whims of FATE; it was "written in stone". That by decree, when the bones and flesh of histories Dark Ages were nothing more than powder grey dust, the augural bells of Notre-Dame would continue, portentous and melodic, echoing under the unseen specter of a deaf hunchback.
