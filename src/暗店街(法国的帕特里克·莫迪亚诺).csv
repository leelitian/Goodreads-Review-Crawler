2`4` I am nothing. Nothing but a pale silhouette that evening, on the terrace of a café. The main protagonist of Rue des Boutiques obscures,  we could as well call him Guy, suffers from amnesia. He works at detective agency and after his boss retirement decides to learn the truth about himself. With this end in view meets many people, frequently emigrants and stateless persons and gathering vague hints, following blurred instructions tries to solve the riddle of own past. From shards and snatches, elusive memoirs, old photos, addresses and phone numbers attempts to build himself anew and reclaim lost identity. One track leads him to another; sometimes Guy comes close the truth, another time track appears to be dead end. All the charm of that novel resides in its atmosphere. In foggy weather mirroring Guy’s state of mind, in the maze of dark alleys which he traverses looking for own footprints, in strange apartments, in dangerously looking staircases, in carefully locked doors, in boxes with jetsam, old photographs and letters. In ambience of melancholy and mystery enhanced by alienation and feeling of constant menace. In, generally speaking, poetics of dream in which it is written.3,5/5
3`4` Patrick Modiano was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 2014. He was virtually unheard of in the United States before then. According to our stated purpose to read only Nobel Prize winning authors or Pulitzer Prize winning novels, my Literary Snobs reading group of two members chose Missing Person, said by several reviewers to be one of his best novels.The author was born in July, 1945, less than a year after the liberation of Paris from German occupation. His mother was a Flemish actress who worked for a Nazi film studio in Paris during the war. His father was a Sephardic Jew who worked the black market and may have been a collaborator for his own protection. These parents neglected their two sons, leaving them with relatives much of the time. The Occupation became Modiano's obsession and most of his books are concerned with it.Missing Person is an atmospheric mystery about Guy Roland, a man who lost his memory during the war and is searching to find out who he was. He had been given a job 10 years earlier by a successful private investigator in Paris, who took Guy under his wing. Knowing about the man's amnesia, the detective procured for him a new identity complete with papers and trained Guy as his assistant.Now this mentor has retired and moved to Nice, but he left the keys to his office to Guy. The novel is the story of Guy's search for his past. He makes use of the voluminous records of persons and incidents in that office, follows up on leads, and gradually begins to piece together who he may have been.Guy moves around from place to place both in Paris and it outskirts, meeting various individuals who keep giving him collections of photos and other memorabilia. I became more and more intrigued with his journeys into shadowy years lost in the general Parisian amnesia about that German occupation.I already knew from reading Simone de Beauvoir's memoirs, that it was a shameful time in Paris. So many collaborated with the Germans, for protection and sometimes simply for enough to eat, but afterwards the collaborators were hated by those who formed the Resistance to the Nazis. Simone de Beauvoir and her lover, Jean Paul Sartre, were part of the Resistance. A decade later, which is when this novel takes place, many just chose to forget all of it.The writing is an expression of the disjointed fragments of Guy's memories. It has a poetic noir feel. Guy, having nothing to lose, is relentless and unafraid though naturally swinging between hopelessness and exhilaration as certain details begin to come back to him.Perhaps Guy's experience would not mean much to readers who never experienced those strange years in France, but the novel won the Prix Goncourt, the French equivalent of the Pulitzer, the year it was published. I was riveted and not even disappointed by the ambiguous ending. It is all about the search.
4`3` الحياه عباره عن مجموعه من الصور القديمه في صندوق الذاكره..هكذا يتعاطي موديانو مع مجريات احداث الروايه ...أولي قراءتي للأديب الفرنسي الشهير ولعلها لن تكون الأخيره...اعتقد ان ترجمه النص افقدته جزءا كبيرا من بريقه بلغته الاصليه
5`3`"'We're not good at dates,' said Sonachidze. 'But, in any case, it goes back to the beginning of time, all that . . .'"Suddenly he seemed exhausted." (pg. 12)In this, the first of many encounters, the protagonist observes two recurring traits: ambiguity and fatigue. Indeed, these traits seem widespread, almost epidemic. If they aren't treated as epidemic it's because they only affect those who expose themselves to the past, giving the past the quality of something tainted or harmful.Ambiguity...The most common form of ambiguity is the obscuring of speech. Someone will be speaking to the protagonist and their speech will be obscured, but the protagonist fails to ask them to repeat. Or the protagonist will say something and the person he is speaking to will not respond, as if they hadn't heard, and the protagonist will fail to repeat himself..."The scrap of speech which I managed ro catch made me feel keenly despondent. Here I was, half-way across a bridge, at night, with a man I did not know, trying to drag some information out of him that would tell me something about myself, and I could not hear him for the noise of trains." (pg. 38)"He had not even heard my question." (pg. 97)"I could not catch the rest of his sentence. I think his voice failed him." (pg. 131)Fatigue..."His concentration was drifting. He had made a mighty effort to speak to me of the past, but it was over. Just like an exhausted swimmer who raises his head a last time above the waves and then lets himself sink slowly . . ." (pg. 132)Many of the encoutners end with the exchange of a physical object that is representative of the past: a box of photos from a Russian immigrant, a box of keepsakes from a gardener, two books and a diary from a young woman, a magazine from a bartender, a book and photographs from an agorophobe.... Only the bartender wants his piece of the past returned, the rest readily or eagerly part with their pieces - evidently haunted by them. From the outset of his case, the protagonist appears to be haunted. At times, there is even the impression that he, the protagonist, is the one haunting. Indeed, he haunts many of the people he encounters, forcing them to recall unpleasant details from the past (the past itself being unpleasant)..."A boat passed, so close, that I had time to see its occupants, framed in the window, sitting at a table and eating, just like us." (pg. 30)"I had the unpleasant sensation that I was dreaming. I had already lived my life and was just a ghost hovering in the tepid air of a Saturday evening." (pg. 40)"He forced himself to sound jolly and gripped my arm as if to prove to himself that I was really there, beside him." (pg. 98)"For me all these voices were voices from beyond the grave, voices of vanished people - wandering voices which could respond to each other only through a discontinued telephone number." (pg. 100)The protagonist encounters a man more haunted than himself, a man who seems to have come to the end of his own investigation, an investigation like the one undertaken by the protagonist, and, having reach unpleasant conclusions, seems to be trapped by the awful implcations of what he has discovered. He holds onto the artifacts of his dead friend. He is preoccupied with the fact that his friend's killer is still at large - which seems to exasperbate his evident agoraphobia.The parallels between the agoraphobic and the protagonist are clear. In the previous chapter, the protagonist describes the colour of a woman's eyes ("She had clear eyes, with a greenness that came and went in them." - pg. 92). In this chapter, reference is made to the colour of the agoraphobic's friend's eyes ("It was as though the man he was talking about was there, in front of us, and was transfixing him with his gray eyes." - pg. 98). In this chapter, the agoraphobic drinks "Marie Brizard" (pg. 101). In a subsequent chapter, the protagonist drinks "Marie Brizard" (pg. 125).Throughout the novel, there is the suggestion of fragmentation in the characters, their lives and their world. They are not whole people. They are missing names. They are missing their pasts. In one instance, two men (one named Jean and the other named Paul) exchange identical goodbyes (pg. 14), creating the suggestion that these are not two whole men, but two half men. Together they would make one whole man (named Jean-Paul) but apart they are two fragmented men.Even after he begins to regain memories of his past life, the protagonist remarks (in a letter to his former employer)..."Until now everything has seemed so chaotic . . . Scraps, shreds have come to light as a result of my searches . . . But then that is perhaps what a life amounts to . . ." (pg. 160)The author never makes specific reference to WW2, the Nazis, or the Occupation. Reference is made to the year in which the novel is set (1965) - from this and other clues we can discern that WW2 and the Occupation contribued in some way to the protagonist's amnesia. But it is more powerful to suggest rather than specifically reference these factors, because it creates an ambiguous political climate that could be reflective of any time in this or any other country. What seems to be more important than these external factors (WW2, the Nazis, the Occupation, etc...) is the toll they take on the population - those who, as the protagonist says, want to "settle down to a quiet life" (pg. 149)."My real name? I wish I knew." (pg. 129)
6`4`"Gente estranha. Deixando à sua passagem uma simples névoa que em breve se dissipa. Muitas vezes conversamos, Hutte e eu, sobre esses seres de quem se perde o rasto. Nascem um belo dia do nada e regressam ao nada depois de terem brilhado por momentos. Rainhas de beleza. Gigolos. Borboletas. A maioria nem em vida tinham mais consistência que um vapor que nunca se condensará...Hutte costumava repetir que, no fundo, somos todos "homens das praias", e que a areia - estou a citar as suas palavras exactas - só conserva alguns instantes a marca dos nossos pés".(Patrick Modiano, Na rua das lojas escuras)
7`5`"I am nothing"Finding a missing person is a challenge enough, but what if you, the person searching, happens to be looking for yourself? Where the hell do you even begin in searching for the clues with no memories of the years gone by? Delving into the past is obviously a good place to start, with a little help of course, slowly picking up pieces of information here and there that begins to bring back small moments and details that unravel a life forgotten. Winner of the Prix Goncourt in 1978, this short novel pays homage to Paris and nostalgia. Modiano's protagonist and part narrator, Guy Roland (a name given to him by his detective agency boss) suffers from almost total amnesia and has been working as a private snoop, solving other people’s mysteries, that is until his boss, Hutte, decides he has had enough, and moves to Nice. He goes on a journey to rediscover himself again. From nothing, to part-something, to someone. Modiano uses the irony of the detective searching for his old life, and I have to say, I was completely enthralled the whole way through, only to be slightly hampered by the abrupt open-ended last chapter. All those he meets along the way either know him or vaguely know of him, but he knows none of them. Sometimes playing along that he does, in the hope of gaining background knowledge. His fragmented mind is like an egg timer, slowly the grains of memory start to fill up the open space. Most of the period in question was the German occupation of Paris before and during World War two. He would learn of a past riddled with intrigue, with those he loved, those he befriended, and those who had suspicious motives.Once again, like with a previously read Modiano, the prose used while exploring the theme of identity, showcases his beautifully deft style, with a haunting and melancholy tone. It's like looking at an old family photo, whom some of those have now departed. He utilizes Paris perfectly, creating scene after scene where one can almost smell the aromas of good coffee, and the after taste of cigarette smoke from the Cafés and restaurants, as he weaves his way around the streets of the city. Just be clear to anyone thinking this may be a Jason Bourne style thriller, it absolutely isn't. Modiano has no interest in exciting set-pieces, guns or violence. The pacing is slow for a reason, and works perfectly in tandem with Guy's task of trying to bring his true self back to life. All the characters he acquaints with come across as very tactile, easy to talk to, and are in some cases sad and lonely. It is a book built on triggered inner feelings and rekindling emotions from a bygone era. There are so many beautiful images that Modiano paints throughout the book, his canvas is one of light and dreamy pastels, rather than deep dark colouring.To some, this could be seen as nothing more than a mystery story with unanswered questions. Anyone that has a heart, will see that there is more to it than that. A sublime and poignant piece of storytelling. I am staggered that most of Modiano's work on GR comes in with such low average ratings. Maybe it just takes a certain kind of reader to appreciate him fully. I am one of them.A memorable 4/5
8`5`"I am nothing. Nothing but a pale shape, silhouetted that evening against the cafe terrace, waiting for the rain to stop..."So begins the story of a man suffering from amnesia during the days of the Paris Occupation and losing his identity. He went to a detective agency to get help and the boss there gave him a name and a job. Guy Roland went on working as a private detective for 10 years. When his boss retired, he set out on a journey to investigate his own past and looked for his lost identity. Layers of memories came back to him when he encountered people, looked at old photographs and listened to fragments of stories assuming to be of his own life.As in real life, will Guy Roland ever find out who he really is? That's a big question. Another strange and clever novel from the Nobel prize winning author Patrick Modiano about fragments of memory, lost self, and hidden identity."I believe that the entrance halls of buildings still retain the echo of footsteps of those who used to cross them and who have since vanished. Something continues to vibrate after they have gone, fading waves, but which can still be picked up if one listens carefully. Perhaps, after all, I never was this Pedro McEvoy, I was nothing, but waves passed through me, sometimes faint, sometimes stronger, and all these scattered echoes afloat in the air crystalized and there I was."

10`5`"L.A. Noire", detective story (noir video game) "Missing Person." Atmospheric. Suspenseful. Delicately drawn film noir scenes unfold in a nuanced search. For self. For memories. For a life lived. In a past lost in a world lost in a city lost in a time lost. Lives lost. Sometimes found.Black & white mist gradually emerge into the yellow smoky fog of memory... ...painting a dusty colored 'remembrance of things past'. Or does it...ever?

11`4`"Looking back at the photographs.Those summer days spent outside corner cafes.Oh, I could write you paragraphs,about my old Parisienne days." (Parisienne Walkways)Đọc xong cuốn này chỉ muốn lôi mớ ảnh trong mấy album cũ ra ngắm :D Sống có ích gì khi ta không nhớ và nhớ có ích gì khi ta không sống? Ở một phương diện nào đó, đọc cuốn này khiến mình nhớ tới Nghĩa địa Praha :)Kết thúc hơi hẫng, giống như đang chạy theo một người trông-rất-quen trong một con hẻm vắng, bỗng dựng người ấy biến mất hút ngay sau một khúc quanh và không bao giờ có thể gặp lại người đó nữa. Lại thành người-xa-lạ.
12`5`"Missing Person" (English title) is an exquisite little book.Guy Roland suffers from amnesia, and after 10 years of living in Paris under an assumed identity, he embarks on a quest to discover his past. Modiano's take on memory and remembrance should be compared (and, importantly, contrasted) to Proust's - Roland spends the length of the novella looking for his memory-triggering madeleine - a photograph, a name in a phone directory, a dressmaker's mannequin, a voice on the telephone, a brass handrail. But every potential cookie either leads to dead ends, unreliable sources, or memories of questionable veracity.A particularly nice recurring motif involves Roland being given collections of keepsakes and artifacts that belonged to others as if his past can only be reconstructed out of the detritus of those who he may (or may not) have known (or been). "It certainly seemed everything ended with old chocolate or biscuit or cigar boxes." In a way, Roland relies on the memories of others to help him reconstruct his own and becomes a construct rather than a blank slate - which, perhaps, we all are anyway.Reading "Missing Person" is also a little like experiencing "L'année dernière à Marienbad." Like that film, the structure is non-linear, the interactions between characters are rather dreamlike, and the depictions of past events are always bathed in a fog of ambiguity. 
13`3`"Pentru o clipă, gândul m-a dus departe de laguna asta, la celălalt capăt al lumii, într-o stațiune balneară din sudul Rusiei, unde fusese făcută fotografia în urmă cu mult timp. O fetiță se întoarce de la plajă, pe înserat, împreună cu mama sa. Plânge din nimic, pentru că ar fi vrut să se mai joace. Se îndepărtează. a dat deja colțul străzii, și nu cumva viețile noastre se risipesc la fel de repede în amurg ca supărarea aceasta de copil?"
14`4`"¿Y acaso no se esfuman el crepúsculo nuestras vidas con la misma facilidad que ese disgusto infantil?" Una frase final que comprende la idea que Modiano ha tratado de reflejar en esta novela de búsqueda identitaria; la idea de que de nuestras vidas, una vez que ya no estemos aquí para vivirlas, solo quedarán unos pocos restos difíciles de perseguir.
15`4`'I stepped forward. Perhaps he would recognise me? Each time I have the same hope and each time I am disappointed."Which Mr Howard de Luz?""Freddie"I said "Freddie" in a different tone of voice, as if it was my own name I was throwing out, after years of having forgotten it.He stared."Freddie ... "At that moment, I really believed he was addressing me by my first name."Freddie? But he's no longer here ... "No, he had not recognised me. No one recognised me."Missing Person, beautifully translated by Daniel Weissbort, was published in the original French in 1978 (as "Rue des Boutiques Obscures" - a more fitting title) and in English in 1980 by Jonathan Cape, although the edition I read was the US one, published by David R. Godine's Verba Mundi label in 2005, after which it languished in relatively obscurity until an autumn 2014 day in Stockholm. Indeed, the story goes that Godine had asked Claude Gallimard to recommend the best French writers unknown in the US, and he recommended Sylvie Germain, JMG Le Clézio and Patrick Modiano - seemingly the Nobel committee may also have asked Gallimard for recommendations.Missing Person tells the story of "Guy Roland", the adopted identity of the narrator after he lost his memory of his own. Having worked as a private detective for 8 years, his employer retires and he goes in search of his own past. His initial clue is relatively slight - two men who believe they know him of old, but aren't sure who he is or even from where they know him.The novel unfolds, at face value, as a noir detective story, as Roland criss-crosses France, and particularly Paris, meeting a succession of characters, each with their own secrets and woes, following an Ariadne's thread of leads towards his true identity,But Mondiano makes his novel so much more than that, in particular an exploration of memory and self-identity, and a subtle portrayal of Occupied Paris in Vichy France.Mondiano's prose is understated and simple but haunting, and his characters are mostly merely sketches, albeit very well drawn ones. Indeed the most memorable character that emerges from the story is the streets of Paris itself, their names, buildings and atmosphere play an important part in Roland, and one suspect Mondiano's, identity.As Roland starts his journey he forces himself to try to identify with stories he is told and places he visits, with an often false sense of deja vu'None of this reminded me of anything and yet these designs must have been familiar to me where I used to sleep in this bed. I searched the ceiling, the walls, and the door area for any sign, any trace, though of what I did not know....Then it was if something clicked in place. The view from this room made me feel anxious, apprehensive, a feeling I had had before. These facades, this deserted street, these figures standing sentry in the dusk distrubed me in the same insidious manner as a song or a once familiar perfume.'As his quest goes on he both starts to discover the real truth, and perhaps why he has blanked it from his consciousness, and recovers flashes of real memories. But he also realises that his quest is ultimately futile: 'The road I remembered looked just like any other mountain road. How could I find it again? And perhaps the chalet was no longer there. And even if it were......Until now everything has seemed chaotic, so fragmented...Scraps, shreds have come to light as a result of my searches...But then that is perhaps what a life amounts to.Is it really my life I'm tracking down? Or someone else's into which I have somehow insinuated myself....Do not our lives dissolve into the evening as quickly as this grief of childhood.'

18`5`***THIS AUTHOR IS THE WINNER OF THE 2014 NOBEL PRIZE FOR LITERATURE.***”I am nothing.Nothing but a pale shape, silhouetted that evening against the cafe terrace, waiting for the rain to stop….”Guy Roland does not know who he is. His past has vanished behind a curtain of amnesia. His made up name is not a source of identity, but merely a convenience for others to refer to him. For ten years he has worked for a private investigator named Hutte. When his boss retires and moves to the city of Nice, Guy decides that maybe it is time to investigate his own past. I’ve known several people who were adopted and most of them have urgently researched their past searching for any clues to the original egg and sperm donor to their existence. Even though their parents have provided everything they could ever want in terms of love and care they still feel like something has been lost. They feel that those missing pieces once known will finally complete them. After experiencing some of the angst of watching my friends search and sometimes find their past I went on this journey with Guy with some trepidation. After all, amnesia doesn’t just happen, lifting the veil, more than likely, is exposing yourself to trauma.The other hazard is that Guy is risking throwing away ten years of a life that could be completely superseded by an old identity. "The sand holds the traces of our footsteps but a few moments."Clues lead him to identities that could be his. He tries these lives on like suits left by dead men. They might fit in the shoulders, but be too constrictive in the chest or need to be longer in the sleeves. He has to reluctantly cast them aside one by one and continue to search. He finds people he once knew, peripheral people who didn’t really know him, but moved in the same circle. Some of their recollections lead him to other people and sometimes something they say hatches a memory, a shadow of a day, the will-o’-the-wisp of a woman. These memories though are frustratingly worthless, mere teasings, etches of greater things. ”I was nothing, but waves passed through me, sometimes faint, sometimes stronger, and all these scattered echoes afloat in the air crystallized and there I was.”Maybe….He follows a trail of broken clues to Rome to Polynesia looking for an elusive friend who could hand him his identity on a silver platter. His whole missing life is gift wrapped in the memories of this childhood playmate. Who will he be when the key finally fits the lock and his own memory of his past is allowed to soar? Patrick Modiano’s father never registered himself as a Jew with the Nazis in Paris. In fact he even went so far as to hang out with the Gestapo and made some money on the blackmarket. Modiano’s first book was La Place de l'Étoile which is about a Jewish collaborator. This book displeased his father so much that he attempted to buy all the copies in print. The theme of Modiano’s work deals with the loss of memory, the loss of self, and hidden identities. One could speculate that all of his work is somewhat of a condemnation or maybe in a milder sense an analysis of his father’s activities during the war. It is easy to judge lives that one has not lived. Modiano was tutored by the great French writer Raymond Queneau who is one of my favorite European authors. I need to read more of Modiano’s work to be better able to make connections that might lead back to his mentor. This book reminded me of the best of film noir with sparse sentences crackling with static electricity, with fog in the streets, and with assignations held within the smoky interiors of bars and restaurants. ”I often mention bars or restaurants, but if it were not for a street or cafe sign from time to time, how would I ever find my way?”I kept having visions (unfulfilled) of the 1987 movie Angel Heart with Mickey Rourke before his face become it’s own horror show. I had fears of what Guy had done or what had been done to him. Modiano carefully, subtly, keeps ratcheting up the tension, the anticipation. He drives the reader further into the plot until your hand is feeling forward into the dark wondering if you will touch flesh or fur or yet another stony dead end.

19`4`1. An idea: use this in a study of differences between noir and neo-noir lit. There is a marked difference, and it doesn't lie in the subject matter, time, or location. Construction and technique seem very cinematic.2. A satisfying read, which takes you into another, closed, even claustrophobic, word - the narrator is first separated from other characters by his lack of memories; when these come back, they're memories of a man who lived in fear.3. The narrative is pretty, but it made me feel suspicious - is the book really as deep as it pretends to be? The story is very streamlined, at times vaguely ominous and incomprehensible (I had to reread the first few paragraphs a few times before finally reading the blurb). Reminds me of Jean Rhys' Parisian novels.
20`3`2014 års nobelpristagare är en sympatisk person, så även hans prosakonst. Vemod och trevande utan svar, är dock inte riktigt det jag gillar.
21`3`3.5
22`3`3.5 stars in terms of being a well-written, sometimes, page-turner.Spoiler:After a while it was just hard to believe he was going to find out anything true about the "missing years" as John Prine would put it. Modiano's characters usually didn't recognize him in the pictures he showed and so the reader can feel this is going nowhere. It does turn out that he remembers a key chapter in his life (during the years of France's occupation in WW2) but then nothing really comes of that. His ending is poetic, but leaves all that pursuit of "reality" and his own past as rather empty or meaningless.
23`5`5 - потому что книга, которую хочется перечитать ещё. 5 - потому что после неё грустно не из-за её героев и их судеб, а из-за того книга пишет про жизнь, мою и вашу в том числе. Кто такой человек без памяти? Разве в памяти не находится весь конструкт нашей идентичности? Что будет, если одним днём мы проснемся без памяти и без своей личности? Что, если каждый день мы забываем свою же жизнь и самих себя? Очень приятная атмосфера книги. Детектив, квест, лабиринты, повороты, интриги, туманы и грусть. Грусть по времени, что ушло. Почти что в поисках потерянного времени, что связано с поисками себя.
24`3`A Nobel Prize winner, you say?After finishing Rue des Boutiques Obscures, I can see why Modiano was awarded the Prize. But then I also see why he shouldn't have been. (I am reflecting on this on the basis of this one novel, which is not fair, but this one also got him Prize Goncourt, so I'd say it's representative). Let me start with the latter, i.e. why I don't see what's so special about his writing.1) It's a roman policier, a detective novel. A person (Pedro McEvoy) trying to find out who he really is. Groundbreaking? Hardly. If you've seen Bourne Identity, or read Robert Ludlum, that's what it is, just slightly less 'thriller' and slightly more 'existentialism'. You read it in one evening. 2) If you think about it, the plot is very banal and some of its features don't make sense at all. You are waiting for eight years to start digging on who you really are? And then miraculously all those people you are supposed to meet, voilà - you just meet them and they tell you snippets of your story, without really questioning how you had lost your memory and what you were doing in the meantime?3) Maybe it's the translation. I've read it in English because that's the book I bought. I will try with a French version next time.On the other hand:1) Is originality crucial? I doubt it. It's the style. Modiano's style is everything but verbose. Simple sentences, rather frugal literary expression, clear and highly readable messages, and yet, when you read the novel, there is a layer of dust on those paragraphs. And Modiano keeps it that way until the end, when - surprise surprise -nothing really makes sense, the same way it didn't at the beginning.2) I've mentioned you read it in one evening. However, it leaves you with a desire to reread it. At least, that was the case with me. I always sense there is something to a book that I wish to reread. Perhaps it's all the descriptions of Paris, so vivid that I feel I'm walking those streets and reaching those corners. Next time in Paris, I will try to visit some of the streets mentioned. Maybe then, I will find in them pieces of Pedro McEvoy. Or, even more likely, I will find pieces of myself. And that, I think, is the point, because Modiano's short novel is not a story about Pedro McEvoy at all. It's a reflection on purpose, on sense, on life.In total: good enough to leave me thinking. Not sure if good enough to win a Nobel. But that, after all, is purely subjective.
25`4`A amnesiac private-eye looks to his past to attempt to discover what happened to him before and during World War II. While searching for his identity, he tries on various personae and imagines himself into the lives of the individuals he meets along the way. Noir-y and brooding, the narrative becomes a meditation on guilt, memory and betrayal.
26`5`A beautiful look at memory and the collective trauma of war and territorial occupation.
27`4`A good smart read, a story that, without evidencing any urgency, draws you forward. You feel an inevitable tug, towards an inevitable conclusion—things could not have ended well. That much you suspect. The narrator an amnesiac, but given the name Guy Roland by his adoptive father, mentor, employer, who is, appropriately enough, a retired private investigator. Roland is a lost soul, damned to wander an interminable autumn. Under these gray skies, he begins to reassemble his identity. Begins but never fully regained, if only because once something is lost, it remains lost. The book follows Roland’s search, a deliberately paced but increasingly anxious passage, through vaguely familiar streets, populated by vaguely remembered names and faces. In this dreamscape Roland not only seeks his identity, but also to discover the fate of a small group of intimates, especially a woman who may or may not have been his lover. What happened in those years?Throughout the slender book, Roland is turned around and around like a man playing blind man's bluff. He turns here, and returns there, always to the same claustrophobic corners. But Modiano is not playing the reader. The pieces, however implausibly assembled, do come together— minor characters, cameos from the past, aging and dead but present in photographs, all, always on the periphery, give hints, fragments, that set him on the right tract. We suspect something happened in Occupied France, decades before. A group of people living too close to the edge. The dark fell and didn’t lift. Winter came. A fatal decision was made. The consequences are never fully explained.In a way “Missing Person” is book about coming to terms with one's life. All lives decay, as all organic matter will. For a short time we are alert and engaged. Then, too soon, we realize we are not of any consequence. History is a broom. Perhaps it is better to live in the dark.
28`4`A haunting noir novel set primarily in France. Modiano paints a rich cast of characters and settings, which I savored, along with a sense of dread, through the end. An amnesiac recaptures his lost WWII years through painstaking, pre technology detective work. A delicious adventure.
29`5`A magical work. Short but very rich.
30`4`A man has lived 10 years suffering from amnesia with a fake identity working for a PI in Paris. His boss is retiring and it is finally time to find out who he is. Following a trail of photos and names we are pulled thru his search back to Occupied Paris and his need to remember. As tidbits come back, was he Russian, was a South American Diplomat, was he a bad guy, what happened to the woman he was with... We hurdle thru his search and the pace quickens as we end up in a ski village on the border of Switzerland. No spoilers here. This is a novella and I read it in one night. His memory and the story is like noir film it is dark and foggy but compelling.
31`3`A man in search for himself. No memory of who he is, he follows a trail of photos of himself as a much younger man. At one point he learns that those who knew him under one name may well have been mistaken about his actual identity because he enjoyed living under an assumed name.Who are you when know one knows who you are?
32`5`A man with amnesia pieces together his possible identities and memories from photos, interviews, records. This "detective story" is very like what Charles Brownson (The Figure of the Detective, 2014) suggests is the future of the detective genre: metafiction in which the elements of the classic mystery exist.Crime--"supposed"Criminal--unclearSuspects--"fluid"Detective--"the reader"Modiano means his novel to be a detective story. The narrator has been given the use of an office (along with records) belonging to a detective named Hutte. The narrator speaks to witnesses, gathers clues, visits relevant locations. But traditional mystery readers might be disappointed. Modiano is really writing about the tricks of memory, and about how we all try to reconstruct the past.
33`3`A narrativa é interessante do ponto de vista do personagem principal e tb de como o autor costura a estória. Porém, como clássico, é morosa em alguns momentos. valeu a leitura desse Nobel de 2014 (acho).
34`4`A neo-noir where the protagonist is attempting to find out who *he* is. He has lost his memory and based on sparse clues he wanders around, desperately asking, "Is this me?" He picks up bits and pieces of his personality from each person he meets, slowly *becoming* someone again. It is not totally clear to me whether he finds out who he is or if he just decides to become someone totally arbitrarily.It is important to note that this is set in France after WWII where many people 'lost' what they did during the war. One possibility is this is the reconstruction of Modiano's father's life.It is an interesting idea but never felt as deep as it should have been.3.5 stars?
35`3`A short and interesting story about a man in post-war Paris who has lost his memory going from place to place to recover it through the memories of others. The writing feels very French to me, and I can't say the whole thing came together in the end in a way I found totally satisfying. But I did enjoy it, and it's very spare, with no wasted space, which I appreciated. Well worth the time it takes to read.
36`3`After I reached the last page, my immediate thought was that the copy I bought was a fake. I thought some pages was missing. The protagonist has come so close, then .... Well, just read it. This book makes you feel like walking down a memory lane.
37`4`After WWII, an amnesiac tries to piece together the people & events of his past. A lyrical, yet spare, examination of identity & history. Modiano is the French author who won the 2014 Nobel for Literature. This particular book was originally published in 1978 in France & won the Prix Goncourt, France's premier literary prize. I love his simple, spare writing style & the hazy, indistinct noir feel the book gives to the mystery of our protagonist finding himself. But, this is not necessarily a book for the fan of standard mysteries as this is an existential examination with images popping into focus, then quickly fading away again. There's no neat resolution, nor are we (as readers) sure of what is true or not, remembered or not, of the events we see as snapshots. 
38`4`Although published in 1978, Patrick Modiano’s Missing Person recalls the World War Two era during which statelessness burdened many Europeans caught in shifting borders, marching armies, forced displacement, and the horrors of concentration and displaced persons camps. In Missing Person, Modiano transforms statelessness into, quite literally, an existential mystery. Guy Roland is a private detective. He’s also stateless, identity-less, and amnesiac. He struggles to unravel the multiple mysteries of his own identity: is he Guy Roland, Pedro McEvoy, or perhaps Jimmy Pedro Stern? Is he Greek, Dominican, or Argentinian? Guy is unsure of even whose identity he’s searching for: ”Is it really my life I’m tracking down? Or someone else’s into which I’ve somehow infiltrated myself?”.Modiano’s fiction consists of several persistent themes that he picks up, arranges, and rearranges in his novels. Sometimes he picks up all of them in a single novel, sometimes he picks up only some of them. Sometimes Modiano gives us a fairly straightforward rendition of a theme that we’ve seen in his other novels, sometimes he riffs on a particular theme in new and unexpected ways. In Missing Person, we see the familiar Modiano themes of photographs as guideposts to rediscovering memories; invisible but lasting evidence of past lives; heartaches of a long-missing wife or girlfriend, here Denise Coudreuse; passing years marked by disappeared city landmarks, no matter how small and seemingly trivial; and even the seemingly casual insertion of a minor historical figure—here the infamous Dominican diplomat Porforio Rubirosa—to orient readers to time and place and provide some historical verisimilitude. But in Missing Person, Modiano riffs on personal nostalgia about faded and forgotten memories, which morph here into the horror of total identity loss. Modiano portrays the depth of Guy’s loss so effectively that it disorients not only Guy but Modiano’s readers as well. I’m rating Missing Person 4.5 on a scale of only Modiano novels, and rounding it up to 5.
39`4`Amnesia is a favourite mental disorder for those who exploit detective plots – it at once provides a mystery and unlocks the wide open space for any manoeuvres.“I am nothing. Nothing but a pale shape, silhouetted that evening against the café terrace, waiting for the rain to stop…”And the main hero embarks on a quest in search of his true identity and his own past.“And in this labyrinthine maze of buildings, staircases and elevators, among these hundreds of cubbyholes, I had found a man who perhaps…I had pressed my brow against the window. Below, each building entrance was lit by a yellow light which would burn all night.”And he always comes to a possibility and never to an assurance that that was his real past…Some lives are just fiction…
40`4`An amnesiac detective prowls around a Paris that is full of shadows, dimlit hallways, and dark corners to retrieve his lost identity, but it seems what remains of the past are now mementos that only his memories can piece together. This novella (150 pp.) reminds of me R. Bolaño's "Monsieur Pain" (because of its noirish atmosphere) & I. Kertesz's "Detective Story" (because of its political undertone)--yet the similarities end there: "Missing Person" is less disjointed than the former and more subtle than the latter. It is about the futility of pursuing wisps of smoke and, in a way, an allegory with a message that sometimes it is much better to forget the past. P. Modiano's stacatto prose gives this novel a sense of urgency (as if you are running down a long spiral staircase, drunk and daydreaming at the same time). A strange little book.(4 out of 5 stars)A passage culled out from the novel (p. 42):Hutte, for instance, used to quote the case of a fellow he called "the beach man." This man had spent forty years of his life on beaches or by the sides of swimming pools, chatting pleasantly with summer visitors and rich idlers. He is to be seen, in his bathing costume, in the corners and backgrounds of thousands of holiday snaps, among groups of happy people, but no one knew his name and why he was there. And no one noticed when one day he vanished from the photographs. I did not dare tell Hutte, but I felt that "the beach man" was myself. Though it would not have surprised him if I had confessed it. Hutte was always saying that, in the end, we were all "beach men" and that "the sand" - I am quoting his own words - "keeps the traces of our footsteps only a few moments."
41`5`An elegant, noirish, strange and melancholy novel and a story of identity or lack thereof. The same refrain is heard about the writings of Modiano - that he keeps writing the same book. Perhaps . . . as the NYT says "only in the way that Cézanne kept painting the same apples." That Monet painted waterlilies, that Degas painted ballet dancers and on. Each one differently.Missing Person is my second book by Nobel Laureate Patrick Modiano (along with Sundays in August) and I'm very much looking forward to reading another soon.
42`5`An engrossing meditation on identity and memory in the form of a noir detective novel. For a decade Guy Roland has been working in a detective agency but has no recollection of the time before that. Even his name was given to him by his boss, Hutte. When Hutte retires, Roland begins following a few, slim leads in search of his former identity and lost memories. Modiano’s elegant spare prose (translated from the French by Daniel Wessbort) is elegant and mesmerizing.
43`4`An existential noir.A detective agency closes in Paris, leaving behind its sole remaining employee: an amnesiac who doesn't even remember his name, conducting one final investigation into his past.He begins by sharing a meal with two bartenders, who think they recall him from one of their former restaurants--wasn't he the companion of the mysterious Russian emigrant from the Tanagra, Styoppa was his name? Or, was he an old customer from the Hotel Castille?Obsessed, and with the benefit of an old social directory, the detective tracks down Styoppa de Dzhagorev at a funeral. From there, the detective secures an invitation to Styoppa's small, stooped apartment, where the Russian reminisces about the emigrant community, bringing out a box of old photographs to share. One of the photographs, in particular, catches the detective's eye:"In the foreground, an old man, stiff and smiling, seated in an armchair. Behind him, a blonde young woman with very limpid eyes. All around, small groups of people, most of whom had their backs to the camera. And toward the left, his right arm cut off by the edge of the picture, his hand on the shoulder of the blonde young woman, an extremely tall man, in a broken check lounge suit, about thirty years old, with dark hair and a thin moustache. I was convinced it was me."Styoppa gives him the photograph and identifies the woman as Gay Orlov, a singer who had gone to America. He doesn't recall the tall man in the lounge suit, nor is he particularly persuaded that the man and the detective are the same person. Yet the detective is convinced, and he pursues the thread, finding several witnesses through the use of the old social directory. He learns that Orlov married an American piano-bar entertainer to obtain a green card, that she was actually in a relationship with a French socialite named Jean Howard de Luz, and that her companions in Paris were the socialite, an English jockey named Wildemar, and an apparent South American diplomat named Pedro McEvoy.As the investigation continues, the leads point the detective towards a single probable identity, and as he closes in, he "remembers" more and more details from his "former life," including details of his relationship, and its tragic end during a failed winter border crossing in an attempt to escape the occupying German police. Yet was he really that person, or was his investigation flawed from the start, reinforced not by the strength of the evidence but rather by confirmation bias?
44`4`As I progressed in this book I began to question if this was a story of a physical exploration of the past and the people who inhabited it or if, instead, this was a remembrance of the past filled with questions that the protagonist was seeking answers for. Either way, Patrick Modiano again shows us what a masterful story teller he is. His books are intimate affairs dealing with the lives of people searching for something they want even when they don't know what that something is.Missing Person is a story about a man suffering from amnesia. The book starts nowhere and ends nowhere. And, this is what makes it so important. Modiano is not interested in writing about certainties. Rather, he reviews the past and asks why we charted courses in our lives that brought us to where we presently exist. Having read six of his books, I am not even sure he is interested in achieving the answers he seems to be looking for. As a reader, what intrigues me in these books is the journey, the exploration that scours the landscapes of France that make up the personal history of the author and his family.Missing Person is a detective story. It's also a reminiscence. But, first and foremost, Missing Person is a book that enfolds the reader in a feeling of nostalgic warmth, that lends attention to the territory of the past in which we all dwell. 
45`5`As always: retracing memories, retracing lost people, places, lifes and finding a person; oneself. As always, a masterpiece from an author that has become essential for me. (Read a Swedish translation.)
46`3`Audiokniha, Český rozhlas Vltava - Četba na pokračování1978 Goncourtovu cenaHlavní hrdina Guy Roland, bývalý detektiv, trpí ztrátou paměti a snaží se zrekonstruovat svoji minulost. Pátrání po své identitě dokumentuje doslovně citací dokladů, popisem fotografií a dialogů s lidmi, s kterými se setká. Při svém pátrání po střípkách odkrývá epizody ze svého života, ale zároveň i osudy jiných lidí na pozadí nacistické okupace Francie. Osudy, které končí často tragicky. Při precizním detektivním pátrání hlavního hrdiny se zároveň ale objevuje mnoho nesrovnalostí v detailech, ty ho vedou opět k nejistotě, zda již jednou vybavené vzpomínky a ověřená fakta jsou opravdu pravdivé. (wikipedie)Knihu bych si nevybrala, ale poslechnutí jedné kapitoly mě vtáhlo. Na druhou stranu je rozhlasové zpracování poněkud otravné.
47`4`Besides winning the hopelessly political award from the Nobel Committee for Anyone-but-the-Capitalist-American-Bastards Literature, Patrick Modiano is also the recipient of the Prix Goncourt Prize, and is apparently a very popular writer in France. Who knew? I enjoyed Missing Person, it was a page turner, it is like a high brow Agatha Christie (only high brow because it is left unsolved). After finishing the book, I read Modiano's lecture to the Nobel committee, and he frankly won me over quite a bit more than his novel did:.Proust’s memory causes the past to reappear in all its detail, like a tableau vivant...Today, I get the sense that memory is much less sure of itself, engaged as it is in a constant struggle against amnesia and oblivion. This layer, this mass of oblivion that obscures everything, means we can only pick up fragments of the past, disconnected traces, fleeting and almost ungraspable human destinies... Yet it has to be the vocation of the novelist, when faced with this large blank page of oblivion, to make a few faded words visible again, like lost icebergs adrift on the surface of the ocean..I could not help but to agree with him: memory to me is more fickle and withholding than it was for Proust. For me, memories, true memories which I have forgotten and am remembering in a truly fresh fashion, do not come to me in detailed vistas, full episodes, nor certainly not in a linear fashion, but rather visual glimpses which seem to me only playful gestures, déjà vu.In Missing Person, Guy Roland suffers from amnesia, and hopes to piece together his past from small clues. Fortunately he is a detective, and is trained in solving these kinds of mysteries! The convenient suspension of disbelief in literature, always a wonderful toy. In his past lies his identity - for ten years he has lived without one, for ten years he has been someone else. Now that he has lived a decade as Guy Roland, is there any present significance to the man he was before? If identity is the culmination of one's past experiences, what does that make of experiences we don't remember? Over our lives we are constantly building the structure of our identity, it is always being refined and more detailed, but do we benefit from renovation? If we have a house with a closet that we have never opened, does it affect us, what's in there? Do our forgotten memories wheedle in our subconscious, or do they die away, ungrasped?
48`5`Bez mučení přiznávám, že než předloni (2014) dostal Modiano Nobelovku, tak jsem o něm nikdy neslyšela (nebo si to alespoň nepamatuji). Už od té doby jsem měla na Ulici Temných krámků zálusk, ale stále to nějak nevycházelo, až teď. A jsem moc ráda, že jsem se si ji v té knihovně konečně půjčila, protože tahle knížka je skvělá. Hlavní hrdina před lety ztratil paměť a teď se rozhodl hledat svou minulost (ale proč až po deseti letech?) Postupně nachází řadu stop, které ho navedou na několik jeho možných identit - vždy se začne vžívat do nějaké minulosti, aby se ukázalo, že tou osobou není. Jeho pátrání je vlastně sledem vzpomínek různých lidí, které jsou různě pokřivené jejich úhlem pohledu, řada věcí je pouze naznačená a prakticky nic není v knize dořešené. U této knihy platí, že cílem je právě ta cesta a na konci vám zůstane víc otázek než odpovědí. Co se stalo s Denise? Kde je Freddie? Jak ztratil Guy paměť? A kdo vlastně je hlavní hrdina? Nic z toho se ve finále v knize nedozvíte, ale kupodivu to není nijak frustrující.Děj je časově hodně rozostřený, určit nějak přesněji "současnost" v knize nelze, jako pevné datum se tam jeví pouze období okupace, vše ostatní je v mlhách (a někdy si časové údaje vyloženě protiřečí). Atmosférou mi knížka připomínala noirové detektivky, ne náhodou byl hlavní hrdina deset let soukromým detektivem. Kontext: Po Tolstého Smrt Ivana Iljiče další skvělá jednohubka. A další z knih, které si budu po přečtení v knihovně kupovat domů.První věta: "Nejsem nic."Poslední věta: "Odchází. Už zahnula za roh ulice, a nerozplývají se snad naše životy v šeru právě tak rychle jako ten dětský zármutek?"
49`4`Brilliant, genius and unique!I have enjoyed this detective novel thoroughly, it seems to me that there has been a trauma in his past during the war that caused his confusion and amnesia, plus at that time the common change of identity of people trying to escape, a new-of-a-kind very interesting read that I wouldn't mind reading another time or two.
50`3`Buena busqueda de él mismo. Detectivesca manera de saber quien es y quien fue. Guiado por una foto donde alguien se parecia a el, me dice que muchas veces nos vemos en el espejo y no tenemos la mas remota idea de quien somos.
51`4`Camus came to mind as I was reading this, as did Simenon. I was struck by the strong influence of film noir. The narrative has beautiful examples of how a scene can be set from a hundred different angles, and the opening of a new chapter is often a delightful discovery, a small mystery within the larger mystery. The journey through this book is what impressed me; the ending did not strike me as forcefully as the uncertainty and anxiety during the middle of the book. A short, worthwhile book that I can easily see reading again for pleasure and enlightenment. 
52`2`Ce roman raconte l'histoire de quelqu'un qui a réussi à refouler dans sons inconscient la mémoiree pénible d'une erreur de judement qui a mené ses proches dans un guet-apens Nazi.Hélas, l'héros n'est pas capable de toujours resister et la mémoire affreuse revient à son conscient. Pour lui, la vérité est un enfer.L'auteur a réussi à me déjouer jusqu'à la fin. J'ai été très surprise quand l'auteur a finallement révéllé la nature de la mémoire qui le traquait. J'aurai donné ce roman qui est competent en soi plus d'étoiles si je n'avais pas lu tant d'autres ouvrages sur le phenomene. Ce qui m'agace encore plus est que ce roman ressemble énormément au "Chercheur de Traces" d'Imre Kertesz. J'ai eu vraiment l'impression d'avoir lu le meme roman deux fois.L'holocaust est un sujet très difficile pour moi. Je veux qu'un auteur m'apporte quelque chose de très nouveau quand il écrit la-dessus.
53`4`Chúng ta luôn bắt gặp mình ở đâu đó có khi chỉ là một câu văn, một dòng văn. Câu chuyện dẫn dắt ta như thể đang xem một cuốn film kiểu Pháp dưới ánh đèn vàng heo hắt. Một người đi tìm lại quá khứ của mình và gặp những người dường như chỉ sống bằng quá khứ của họ. Những gì đẹp nhất đều đã qua. Một người cao lớn sống trong một căn phòng luôn phải cúi đầu và tiếp khách bằng cách cả hai cùng nằm, một nhạc công chơi nhạc tại bar hằng đêm nhưng lại sợ tiếng ồn, một nhà phê bình ẩm thực nhưng lại thấy ăn uống là một cực hình, một nhiếp ảnh gia lẩn trốn mọi ánh nhìn...Modiano là vậy. Nó khiến ta chìm trong miên man, thực sự ám ảnh. Và khi đóng quyển sách lại ta thấy như thứ gì vừa tuột khỏi tay, một thứ gì khó gọi tên vừa mất đi.
54`2`Chắc do đọc không hiểu nên không biết nó hay ở chỗ nào ? Vì đây là sách đoạt giải Nobel (+tiếc tiền) nên cố mà nuốt hết, biết đâu một ngày nào đó nhớ ra lại cảm được, lại thấy hay ? Việc đọc này cũng như khi nghe nhạc rap, mới đầu thấy rất khó nghe, nhưng cố nghe thế là nghe được, bây giờ thì thấy hay...Đọc cả quyển có lẽ nhớ nhất câu cuối tác giả ví cuộc đời mình cũng thoảng qua như nỗi hờn giận của cô bé, trong một chiều hoàng hôn, bị mẹ bắt về nhà không cho chơi tiếp. Lúc đọc đến đấy thấy buồn, cuộc đời con người sao mà nó lại hời hợt thế, chẳng ghi dấu lại ở đâu cả nếu tất cả những người quen chết hết thì có nghĩa mọi dấu vết đều biến mất, bản thân mình cứ như chưa từng sinh ra, chưa từng hít thở không khí trên trái đất này. Ôi buồn, quá buồn cho những số phận tầm thường như mình và những con người giống mình, không phải vĩ nhân .
55`1`Comme Fleur Pellerin, je n'avais jamais lu Modiano. Avec l'attribution du prix Nobel, je me suis dit qu'il fallait m'y mettre ! A priori, je l'ai trouvé bien mince : j'aime les livres plus gros !A la lecture, j'ai trouvé ce roman proprement étique. J'ai surtout été surpris de découvrir une écriture ordinaire et sans relief, ou peut-être l'absence de style comme style. L'histoire, à la dire comme ça, est celle d'un roman policier, soit un enquêteur amnésique cherchant à faire la lumière sur son propre passé. Mais Modiano enchaîne les épisodes comme on enfile les perles : Untel me dit d'aller voir tel autre, qui me donne un papier avec une adresse dessus, où je rencontre Machin qui... A cet égard, la désinvolture de Modiano culmine dans le fait que le lecteur ne sait pas ce qui met, au départ, le narrateur sur la voie.De plus, l'absence quasi totale de repères temporels, qui vise peut-être à un effet de flou artistique, empêche de saisir, avant la toute fin, le véritable enjeu de l'enquête. Enfin, l'ensemble manque à mon goût de profondeur romanesque. Une couleur de cheveux ou un nom exotique ne font pas un personnage, et des noms de rue ne suffisent pas à planter un décor.
56`4`Commentaires :Ce livre de P. Modiano est très spécial. Il est écrit dans un style à lui, avec des phrases courtes, simples, claires, "sans style". Il y a même des fautes de français et le récit est écrit à la 1ère personne, ce qui donne l'impression que l'on comprend très bien ce qui se passeL'auteur, amnésique, nous fait bien rentrer dans l'intrigue car comme lui, on ne comprend pas tout au premier abord..On imagine que finalement, leur vie pourrait etre la nôtre. Au même titre que l'auteur, on essaie de comprendre la mémoire qu'il essaie de reconstruire. Finalement, la mémoire, ce sont des "photographies", des "scènes" que l'on reconstruit par petit morceau. Au fond, la vie dont on se souvient est-elle celle que l'on a vécu ?Sans être "Pedro", nous imaginons très bien ce que c'est que de se souvenir d'être Pedro. On reconstruit notre vie avec le narrateur comme si c'était la nôtre. Et on peut s'imaginer avoir les souvenirs de plusieurs vies.P. Modiano essaie aussi de se souvenir de ce que c'est la 2nde guerre mondiale, une époque oubliée dont on peut se rappeler par fragmentRésumé :Guy Roland est un détective qui après la retraite de son patron, Hutte, décide de partir en 1965 à la recherche de sa propre identité qu'il a perdue après un accident mystérieux qui l'a laissé amnésique depuis plus de 15 ans. Remontant les pistes ténues de son passé qui semble s'arrêter pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale, il apprend qu'il se nomme Jimmy Pedro Stern, un grec-juif de Salonique vivant à Paris sous un nom d'emprunt, Pedro McEvoy, et travaillant pour la légation de la République dominicaine. Ce Pedro McEvoy était entouré d'amis, Denise Coudreuse un mannequin français qui partage sa vie, Freddie Howard de Luz un Anglais de l'île Maurice, Gay Orlow une danseuse américaine d'origine russe, André Wildmer un ancien jockey anglais, qui tous ensemble décidèrent en 1940 de se rendre à Megève afin de fuir un Paris devenu de plus en plus oppressant sous l'Occupation allemande. Denise et Pedro, qui avaient décidé de partir au Portugal passant par la Suisse, et payèrent un passeur (Oleg de Wrédé, un russe et Besson, un moniteur) qui les abandonna chacun de leurs côté dans la montagne, les laissant seuls et perdus dans la neige.Guy Roland décide de retrouver Freddie qui est allé vivre en Polynésie après la guerre. Au moment où il arrive à Bora Bora, il apprend que celui-ci a disparu dans un naufrage quelques jours plus tôt. Il ne reste plus à Guy-Pedro Stern qu'une dernière piste pour renouer les fils de son passé : une adresse qu'il aurait occupée à Rome, dans les années 1930, au 2, rue des Boutiques obscures
57`4`Considering that it won the Goncourt and made the author's name in France, the book felt somewhat unsatisfying - it is an easy read and has the usual Modiano ambiguity, but here it subtracts rather than adds to the feel; maybe it's just that the author got better at writing ambiguous stories/endings and when published this felt new for the time so it got the honors but did not age that well, maybe I didn't read it at the right time, but overall among the weaker novels of the author imho
58`2`Could it be the translation? I read this in English, the novel of 250 pages, about somebody looking for a missing person (the English title), namely his own forgotten identity and past. It leads nowhere but to stating the relativity of identity. Nothing Borges couldn't have said in 16 pages. A good few very well written passages, truly enjoyable moments of intense characterization. The book seems to be constructed like one of those old monoculars that you draw out, but time has turned it upside down - each scene possibly leading further into the unknown past, everything becomes both unknown, yet imaginably known - the novel procedes through various meetings, talks and old photos. Admitted, I didn't continue for all of the ride. Maybe somebody will let me know what I missed
59`4`Câu chuyện của một người đi tìm lại quá khứ của mình. Paris xuất hiện trong cuốn sách với sự trầm lặng, yên tĩnh và ám ảnh đi cùng của bao con người.Nhẹ nhàng và vương vấn như một chùm hoa giấy.
60`2`Disappointed in the way it ended.
61`5`Do you know how many books with the word "missing" in the title there are listed here at Goodreads? I'll tell you: a bunch. And a lot of them include the words "person" or "persons" in the title. But I'll bet you that the plot in this Missing Person differs from all the rest.On the surface it is much like hundreds of other novels in which a man has lost his memory. What is different, however, is that in the years since that memory loss he has become a trained private detective. Therefore, he is especially equipped to backtrack in a quest to discover his true identity. Now, I'm not giving anything away here because the reader finds this out in the opening pages. And that is as far as I am going to go with my review, because I want to turn that job over to someone else.I want to thank my Goodreads good friend Carol for leading me to this book, one that I would never have discovered without her help, and one that I thoroughly enjoyed -- yuuugely. So, I'm going to send you to the fine review that sparked my interest and led me to this book. You can read her review here: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...
62`4`El personaje principal carece de memoria y de pasado, Modiano nos hace sentir que tampoco los lectores la tenemos. Junto en el transcurso del libro, vamos recordando cada una de las páginas de la vida de este personaje desmemoriado sólo hasta al final, vemos como el personaje su pasado. Muy bien escrito, seguro le dieron el Nobel por su forma intrincada y a la ves clarísima de su ágil pluma. Recomendable, muy recomendable.
63`3`Em busca de uma identidade perdida, num mundo muito diferente do nosso, antiquado para os nossos parâmetros. Mas sentimos a perda do narrador, o seu desânimo e vontade de encontrar-se.
64`5`En man förlorar minnet. Identitetsförvirring. Vem är han?Han söker efter sitt förflutna. En del av livet som är oförenlig med presens. Ett uppbrott, en kris, ett krig. Skuggor i skymningen. En skiljelinje mellan då och nu. Vad händer när en hel nation går igenom en kris? Och glömmer bort vem den en gång var?
65`3`En serio este hombre no es para mi. Será premio Nobel y la leche en verso, pero es un pesado de primera y me da rabia porque normalmente tiene todo para construir grandes historias pero se centra tanto en las pequeñeces que se hace pesado y luego suele concluir de mala manera. Como es el caso de esta historia. Tiene su aquel en cuanto a intriga, pero repito, no es para mi.
66`5`Eroul romanului se străduie să pună cap-la-cap un puzzle al unor amintiri pierdute. O poveste spusă într-un stil al unui film noir cu personaje care parcă se perindă printr-un labirint în timp și spațiu...
67`3`Es un libro interesante por su estilo, por su atmósfera, por sus escenarios pero que no termina logrando un gran acometido. Me pareció un final bastante plano pero reconozco la gran capacidad de transportarte al mundo oscuro de detectives que tuvo el autor.
68`3`Estuve en París por primera vez en el año 2002, me parece. Iba de mochilera y, como tal, recorrí la ciudad deprisa y corriendo. Esas cosas que se hacen con veinte y pocos años, de abarcar la mayor cantidad posible de kilómetros en el menor tiempo posible. Me pareció una ciudad majestuosa, impresionante, inabarcable. Demasiado grande, tal vez, demasiado fría.Leí a Modiano por primera vez en el 2015. Tuvo que recibir el Premio Nobel para que mi atención se dirigiera a él, y tuvo que llegar una festividad literaria masiva (Sant Jordi) para que una de sus novelas llegara a mis manos.Y aún bajo el riesgo de saber poco del autor, y tras leer Calle de las tiendas oscuras, he llegado a la conclusión de que Modiano es un poco como París. Majestuoso en el uso del idioma, suscinto pero contundente, impresionante, un poco más grande de lo que puedo comprender de una primera mirada. Y algo frío, eso también.

69`4`Excellent!
70`2`Favorite line: “Is it really my life I’m tracking down? Or someone else’s into which i have somehow infiltrated myself?”SPOILER ALERT: 3/4 of the book the narrator remembers almost nothing, then final quarter he inexplicably explains everything, yet somehow in closing pages he is still in search for a last sliver of who he is. Nice storytelling but no great story. Difficult to connect with many of these characters.
71`2`Frenchman Patrick Modiano won the Nobel Prize for Literature this month, mainly for work he did in the book Rue des Boutiques Obscures, which translated is, in English, Missing Person. I just don't see the reasoning behind this award. The story is an endless dull grind of Guy Roland looking, searching, for his "real" identity, lost with his total amnesia more than eight years previous. While not as dull and depressing as some French writing, this “detective story” still left me cold. I didn't find the writing particularly lovely or expressive. The individuals Roland encounters along the way are eccentric and vaguely ominous. I began to wonder at all the people who had committed suicide in the book, suspecting a horrible disclosure. No such climactic reveal, I should have known. Even Simenon, the Belgian detective story master, manages to make crime boring, so how much more a literary philosopher?It is probably a pretty accurate and atmospheric trip through Paris and its quartiers, with glimpses of wartime streets, but, hm, hasn't that been done a bit elsewhere? The ending really bugged me, too. Sheesh. All that work to get to a conclusion like that? No spoilers here, just my gut reaction. I definitely feel they should have given the award to someone else. ~ Tessa Eger November 2014
72`3`Giọng văn đều, trầm, nhưng không buồn. Truyện nhiều nhân vật, nhiều tính cách, tạo bối cảnh truyện khá rõ rệt. Truyện vẽ nên một Paris khá lạ lẫm. Truyện trinh thám, viết theo giọng tường thuật, không dài dòng, nhưng cũng không kịch tính. Các hình ảnh, con người, cảnh vật lần lượt lướt qua như một cuốn phim quay chậm. Nếu nhìn về góc cạnh trinh thám, cuốn sách này không hấp dẫn đứa mê truyện trinh thám giống mình. Nếu nhìn về góc nhìn văn chương, có lẽ nó hấp dẫn về chủ đề: đi tìm nguốn gốc của mình. Câu hỏi tưởng đơn giản nhưng phức tạp. Mình đã là ai? Đã sinh ra lớn lên thế nào? Kẻ là mình hiện tại có liên quan / giống / khác gì mình ngày xưa? Những thứ đã quên là gì? Mình trước giờ nghĩ đến câu hỏi này theo góc độ kiếp sống, hoặc thi thoảng tự hỏi về nguyên nhân của một số tính cách của bản thân. Nhưng mình không nghĩ đến quá khứ hiện tại đơn thuần theo kiểu tìm kiếm, nhưng có lẽ nó sẽ quan trọng đối với những người là con nuôi, hay là những người con thế hệ F1 sinh ra ở một xứ khác như con mình, một ngày sẽ đặt câu hỏi về nguồn cội, làm một hành trình tìm kiếm một điều gì đó. Có thể xem sách có chủ đề hay!
73`5`Great book! Even though a translation, I really enjoyed this book.
74`4`Great writing!!! The author used vivid descriptions of people, places, and things. One got the feeling of being present in the story.
75`5`Guy Roland,hlavná postava je nový Cudzinec. Kniha o pamäti,o jej strate či zabúdaní na život,o strate identity o blúdení vo svojej vlastnej minulosti. Somnabulistický labyrint v ktorom hlavná postava hľadá dvere,ktorými by sa mohol dostať bližšie k tomu kým raz bol. Pocit apatie,kafkovského blúdenia chodbami a labyrintmi,stretnutia s ľudmi,ktorí sú akoby duchmi,a na ktorých sa už dávno zabudlo. Kniha sa mi veľmi páčila práve pre jej francúzsky pocit,či akúsi existenciálnu úzkosť,opisy ulíc,obrazy prázdnych budov a ľudí,ktorí sa len tak mihnú na periférii hlavnej postavy. 
76`5`Here I am, writing from behind my proxy, protecting my identity.But who knows whether I do have one? What if I were a multitude or a composite of anonymous voices? Or what if my self was nothing but an entanglement of separate lifelines? Could my identity be a broken prism of distorting mirrors?Engrossed in this magnificent novel, I certainly would forget myself.Under the guise of a detective story with a ‘noir’ tint, Modiano has span an investigation into the nature of identity that is as beguiling as a lyrical song. Seemingly residing in a name, a nationality, a year of birth, a telephone number, in facts that can be established in an identity card, we soon surmise however that identity is elusive. May be as fleeting as the scent of a perfume, sporadic snowflakes, of the tears of a child. The search takes us through a maze of disappearing footprints that only leave behind a long list of street names, mostly Parisian streets. It is as if the addresses had kept the singularities of the numerous personalities who have resided there, and those streets and numbers become the persons.Similarly with photographs. Are we they? To what extent these silver printed images constitute our selves? Have they appropriated our being?The succession of incongruous personalities, the unpredictable dialogues, the unlikely but treasured cues confer to this novel a flavor of the absurd that kept me fascinated. Indeed, a point came when it seemed that congruity would violate the uncanny nature of the story, and I felt dismay. But no, the baffling evocation continued.Modiano’s investigation of the nature of the self is more perplexing and entails a deeper suspense than a common thriller. The reflection on how we construe ourselves, whether out of our recorded memories, or through our imagination, or from the echoes we perceive from the way others see us, is admirably expanded in this beautiful novel. Even if we close the book realizing that ultimately one is alone in this quest and that there may no end to it.The riddle is partly, and wrongly, given away in the title of the English translation. I find Missing Person it too discernible and unsuitable to Modiano’s ingenious writing and thinking. The original title is the French translation of the street in Rome where Mondiano used to live, Via delle botteghe oscure. He must have felt that he had left part of his identity there.
77`4`Hutte, for instance, used to quote the case of a fellow he called "the beach man." This man had spent forty years of his life on beaches or by the sides of swimming pools, chatting pleasantly with summer visitors and rich idlers. He is to be seen, in his bathing costume, in the corners and backgrounds of thousands of holiday snaps, among groups of happy people, but no one knew his name and why he was there. And no one noticed when one day he vanished from the photographs.A.S. Byatt once noted she finished David Mitchell's Ghostwritten at a busy airport baggage carousel and found the location infinitely appropriate. Likewise I found myself this morning in a darkened swirl of insomnia and read the final 100 pages of Missing Person. Periodically I stared about our quiet living room. I looked at where this afternoon I'll put the Christmas tree I buy at the supermarket. I looked out the window and the neighbors' seasonal lights. I don't question why we don't employ our own. I just don't. Life is often hazy and ill-defined. I wish I had the means at the disposal of Modiano's protagonist. I certainly liked this one better than my previous exposure to the Nobel Laureate. I think the sinister whispers of history were significant here. I'd recommend Missing Person as a premium point of departure for this strange author. 
78`5`I am Nothing"Je ne suis rien" (I am nothing)—the opening phrase of this 1978 novel which won the Prix Goncourt for Patrick Modiano, now the most recent winner of the Nobel Prize. The protagonist is a private detective named Guy Roland. Only this is merely the name given to him by Hutte, his former employer at the detective agency when he rescued him from total amnesia a dozen years before, and gave him a job. Now Hutte is retiring to Nice, leaving Guy with only one case to investigate: his own.Yes, it is a totally implausible concept, but Modiano is less interested in the mechanism of Guy's search for self than in what that search will reveal. The detective will follow a number of clues, each time finding somebody who will give him a tiny part of his story, but not the whole of it. The story is implausible too in that Guy gets almost none of the "Why bother me?" kinds of reaction that one might expect. Almost all his informants seem glad to talk with him; they invite him to their homes and give him boxes of souvenirs to go away with. This, even as Guy himself is having to pose as someone else to gain their confidence, trying on one possible role after another, as he gradually works out who he must be. And, as he does so, he begins to have flashes of memory of his own.Artificial though the mechanism may be, there is none of the surrealism that one associates with many mid-century French writers. Modiano copies the "policier" style perfectly; his noir settings and vivid dialogue could come from the pen of Simenon or any of his followers. "The lights in the bar dimmed, as they do in some dance-halls at the beginning of a slow fox."* There is a fascination with his journeys into various quarters of Paris to meet new informants: a cocktail pianist, a jockey, various Russian expatriates, others of mixed or uncertain nationality. Although the original French title, "Rue des Boutiques Obscures" ("Street of Shady Shops" perhaps?) turns out to have little to do with Paris, but to refer to the headquarters of the Communist Party in Rome, the roman-noir idea of secrets hiding behind closed doors is a powerful and compelling one. This is an easy book to read, and I soon found myself swept up in its momentum. Here is a longer example that captures both theme and atmosphere well:In the lobbies of apartment buildings, I believe that you can still hear echoes of the footsteps of those who once crossed them but have now disappeared. Something continues to vibrate after their passing, sound waves getting weaker and weaker, but which you can still catch if you try. When it comes down to it, it may be that I never was this Pedro McEvoy, I never was anything; but the waves that passed by me, sometimes distant and sometimes closer, and all those echoes that hung in the air crystallized and that was me.*It is writing of this caliber that raises Modiano above the level of the normal detective novelist. But also the question of where the protagonist's inquiries will take him. I do not want to say too much, but it becomes clear that his story will come to a head during the period of German occupation. Modiano has said that many of his novels use memory to explore the experience of his father, who was Jewish but survived the occupation. That does not appear to be the specific theme here, although references to "those years of night" crop up increasingly among the protagonist's informants. Although the novel builds to a climax that manages to be exciting and desolate at the same time, there have been other authors since who have pulled the net tighter and painted in darker tones. In short, I see this as an approachable and meaningful introduction to the work of this latest Nobelist, though I suspect that the reason for his winning the Prize has more to do with the totality of his oeuvre than the quality of any one book.======The review above, originally for Amazon, gives my somewhat bewildered reaction to reading my first Modiano; his Nobel Prize had just been announced, and I wanted to get a sense of him. At the time, I gave it only four stars, but I also sensed that reading him might easily become addictive. And indeed, that has proved to be the case. My second attempt, the trilogy of novellas translated as Suspended Sentences: Three Novellas, turned me into an addict. They also confirmed something that I did not know at the time of reading: that Modiano is concerned with unlocking the past, especially as it relates to the Occupation when his father, though a Jew and a petty criminal himself, was believed to have worked as a Gestapo collaborator.At the time of writing, however, I was still working things out. In the comments, I added the following footnote::Most of the characters in the novel appear to be fictional, but there is one who is not. This is a Russian expatriate named Gay Orlow (Galina Orlova), who became a dancer in New York and began an affair with Lucky Luciano before returning to France. Although she is never a foreground character in Modiano's book, she is very important indeed to the background. But I can see no reason whatever why he chose a real figure rather than inventing his characters as he did the others.And a fellow reader known as "bibliophile" replied with this:Another character mentioned in the book who is not fictional is Porfirio Rubirosa, the Dominican diplomat, and later famous playboy, who, during the 1930s, made money from selling visas to Jews trying to escape Europe. In Modiano's book he provides Dominican passports to some of the characters.I have since realized that the combination of real and fictional is a hallmark of Modiano's writing, from his very first novel, .La Place de l’étoile. to and beyond his masterpiece, Dora Bruder, which is so real it might almost be non-fiction.======*Since I read this in French, this translation is mine, although there is an English version available under the title Missing Person. The original French text of my first quote is:.La lumière du bar baissa, comme dans certains dancings aux premières mesures d'un slow.…and that of the longer excerpt is as follows:.Je crois qu'on entend encore dans les entrées d'immeubles l'écho des pas de ceux qui avaient l'habitude de les traverser et qui, depuis, ont disparu. Quelque chose continue de vibrer après leur passage, des ondes de plus en plus faibles, mais que l'on capte si l'on est attentif. Au fond, je n'avais peut-être jamais été ce Pedro McEvoy, je n'étais rien, mais des ondes me traversaient, tantôt lointaines, tantôt plus fortes et tous ces échos épars qui flottaient dans l'air se critallisaient et c'était moi..
79`4`I basically inhaled this book! The story got under my skin in a non aggressive way and I just couldn’t stop reading. I loved how towards the end the story got more intense by shortening the parts.
80`1`I don't like it !
81`3`I enjoyed Villa Triste much more. This book got better in the last 1/3, but the first half was really wandering and the prose didn't spark enough for the wandering to be okay. The conceit, of a man with amnesia thinking out his possible lives, is a good one, and the sections where the book does that were the best. But the whole investigation aspect just never really grabbed me. It's possible that a better knowledge of Paris or France would've helped? Not sure.
82`4`I enjoyed this book very much. It was spare, thoughtful and melancholy. I think I might have understood it better if I understood France after the war better. This may need a reread
83`4`I first became aware of Patrick Modiano, the French writer, when he won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2014. I learned that he had an extensive and serious body of work and had won many literary prizes, including the Prix Goncourt in 1978 for this book, Missing Person. I read that this was considered perhaps his seminal work on the exploration of identity and so it seemed a good place to make his acquaintance.I must confess I found my introduction confusing in the extreme. The story was quite difficult to follow. In the last chapters, the author finally brought all the facts together and it began to make sense but I spent much of my time in reading the book in a fog. That may have been the writer's intent.On one level, this is a detective story; the protagonist and reader decipher and follow the clues, trying to resolve the mystery. The difference is that the mystery here is the identity of the protagonist.The time is 1965 and the protagonist who is known as Guy Roland has been suffering from amnesia since sometime in the Occupation of France in World War II. He doesn't know who he is or anything about his history. His name and current identity were given to him by a private detective who tried to help him investigate his past. When he was unable to discover his true identity, he gave his client a new one. Then he gave him a job and for several years Guy Roland worked as a detective.Finally, his boss has retired and has turned all of his reference books and records over to Guy. Now, he has decided to take another crack at finding out who he really is.Modiano's descriptions of people and places and atmosphere were the best thing about the book for me. He is just superb at setting the stage and making one see and feel the mise en scène. In nearly all of those settings, fog, or sometimes snow or rain, plays a part, reducing visibility and making one struggle to orient oneself and find a way through the terrain. The protagonist is constantly disoriented and so is the reader. But wasn't it brilliant of the author to make us feel that experience?So, what is the self? Where does it reside? Is it constructed of our past experiences, and if we forget those, do we lose ourselves? Or is it simply something innate that is always with us, regardless of our experiences? Is it a construct of the present, something that is renewed day by day? Or perhaps it is a combination of all that and more. These are the questions that Modiano considers and that he wants us to think about. When I started writing this review, I had mentally assigned the book a three-star rating, but as I've been forced to think more about it as I write, I have to change that to four stars. Even though on some level I found the book annoying and confusing, I think the writer succeeded magnificently in his objective.
84`4`I had never heard of Patrick Modiano until he won the 2014 Nobel Prize for literature. The press release suggested that "Missing Person" was one of his best novels and a good place to start, so that's what I did. It's a mystery novel with the setting in Paris during, I believe, the 1970's, although I don't recall that being stated. Guy Roland is a private detective and his boss is retiring, which will leave Roland free to embark on the most important case of all, to find out who he really is. His memory from his earlier life is gone, Guy Roland isn't even his real name. The blank space in his memory is from the 1940's, the Paris Occupation by the German's. Who was he then, who were the people he knew, who did he love, what happened? Roland has a few clues, names of people who may know something, and as he meets each one he gathers more information, pictures, letters, things that lead him further along.The hook in this novel comes early enough so it's easy to stay engaged. The writing is excellent, not surprising, a very distinct and simple style. There was something about it that reminded me of Hemingway, not so much the style, probably the location and the war aspect. I want to read more of Modiano's work, I was really impressed. The only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars was the ending, but I will still gladly recommend it to my friends.
85`4`I had never heard of this author before he got the Nobel Prize this year. I can't remember now, but this may been the only title easily available to me. I can't decide, but for me this was between a (strong) three and four stars. I enjoyed how things unfolded as the narrator tried to find his identity and I enjoyed the atmosphere even if some of the writing (or perhaps translation) seemed a little stilted to me, but I never felt attached to the character or invested in the outcome. I also felt frustrated that some other mysteries came to the surface during his search for himself, but were never investigated (unless those went over my head, which is possible). My final complaint is about the ending. I saw the pages diminishing, but didn't feel like I was getting any closer to knowing if the narrator would resolve things. And then he left Paris altogether. To me, the conclusion felt rushed and forced and didn't leave me feeling satisfied about all the threads coming together.Maybe I just need to read it again, which wouldn't be a problem. It's short and reads quickly and the writing, despite a couple things here and there, is enjoyable to read.
86`4`I have a story and then a question for you. Here is the story. The main character, our hero, has amnesia. He doesn’t remember anything from his past. Someone is nice to him and gets him new papers and a new identity. But our hero wants to discover his past and find out who he really is. So one day he takes the flimsy clues he has and starts working on them. He meets some people who seem to remember him vaguely. One thing leads to another and he sees someone resembling himself in a photo. He tries tracking down the other people in the photo. After following up a clue, he realizes that he is one person. But then he reaches a dead end and then he follows another clue and he realizes that he is another person. This continues fascinatingly as our hero tries to grapple with his past as more people resembling him keep cropping up and he discovers secrets about people he might have known, without discovering who he actually is. Does our hero find out who he truly is?Now, the question. Does the above plot sound familiar? Can you guess which novel it is? Of course you do. If we let our imagination run a little bit wild and add a bullet wound to our hero which made him amnesiac and forget his past, and add a few bad guys who chase our hero for something that he may or may not have done, we can easily guess that this is the story told in .‘The Bourne Identity’. by Robert Ludlum. Well, you and I would be both right and wrong.The above is the story told in .‘Missing Person’. by Patrick Modiano. When I read about this book in Lance Donaldson-Evans’ ‘One Hundred Great French Books’, I found its resemblance to ‘The Bourne Identity’ uncanny. These days, I keep spotting books which resemble twins separated at birth – a recent book or a popular book in English, which was a big hit among its readers and another one which looks like its twin, which is written in another language, which was published earlier and which is not very widely known. Most of the time, this older twin doesn’t get the credit it deserves and doesn’t even merit a mention by the writer of the more popular work. The cynic in me thinks that the writer of the popular work read the original in translation, got inspired by the main idea and rewrote it in English in an attractive way and cornered all the fame and fortune. Sometimes these popular works are iconic works in English and that pains me even more, because the source is almost never acknowledged or is given the short shrift. Well, when I discovered Patrick Modiano’s book, I thought that something like that must have happened here too. I even went and checked the publishing dates of both the books. Modiano’s book was published in 1978, while Ludlum’s book was published in 1980. I think there is enough time there to read a book and get inspired by it. Ludlum himself says this, while talking about what inspired him to write the Bourne series (excerpted from Wikipedia) :Interestingly, the idea behind the Bourne trilogy was conceptualized after his (Ludlum’s) own experience with temporary amnesia. After his first book, The Scarlatti Inheritance, was published, he could not remember 12 hours of his life. This event, combined with thrilling real-life spy stories, inspired him to write the Jason Bourne trilogy.We will never know what the truth is because Ludlum is not around to confirm whatever theory one might come up with, but it was fascinating for me to spot this random connection and potential inspiration. Now a closer look at Modiano’s book.Modiano’s book won the Prix Goncourt in 1978. So when we look beyond the plot similarities that it has with Ludlum’s book, it is very different. It is literary. There are beautiful images that Modiano paints throughtout the book. Here are a couple of images on pronouncing names :He pronounced the name in the Russian way. It was very soft, like wind rustling in the trees.He handed me the photographs one by one, telling me the names and dates he read on the back : it was a litany, to which the Russian names lent a particular resonance, now explosive like cymbals clashing, now plaintive or almost mute.And here is one on the fog : A fog had come up, soft but with an icy feel to it. It filled your lungs with such cold that you felt you were floating on air.And here are a couple on sound and music :…the sound of it stirred something in me, something as fleeting as moonlight passing over some object.…a tune, played on the saxophone, followed, so pure it melted into the air.And here is one on echoes of the past :I believe that the entrance halls of buildings still retain the echo of footprints of those who used to cross them and who have since vanished. Something continues to vibrate after they have gone, fading waves, but which can still be picked up if one listens carefully.And here is one on expressing the essence :…when I sipped this liqueur, it blended in with the rather cloying satins, ivories and gilt around me. It expressed the very essence of this apartment.‘Missing Person’ is not just the search of the main character for his past, but it is also a meditation on identity and what makes a person who he or she is. It asks interesting questions on what and who we are – whether we are the products of our past, or whether we are what we do and think in the present or whether we are a summation of our future potential. It is a fascinating philosophical question that is explored in the book through the search of Guy Roland for his past. At some point our hero says this : Until now everything has seemed so chaotic, so fragmented…Scraps, shreds have come to light as a result of my searches…But then that is perhaps what a life amounts to.. Is it really my life I’m tracking down? Or someone else’s into which I have somehow infiltrated myself?Fascinating lines which make us think.Does Guy Roland find out about his past? You have to read the book to find out. I liked ‘Missing Person’ very much. It was partly a mystery story and partly a meditation into the meaning of identity. I loved imagining the beautiful images that Modiano paints throughout the book. The ending is a bit open, which also made it interesting and which would have led to a lot of conversations and debates when the book was first published. This is my first Prix Goncourt book and I am hoping to read more in the future.Have you read Patrick Modiano’s ‘Missing Person’? What do you think about it?
87`4`I have been wanting to read Patrick Modiano; not only has he won a handful of awards, he is the recipient of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Literature. The Nobel was “for the art of memory with which he has evoked the most ungraspable of human destinies” but the committee also called him the “Marcel Proust of our time”. Unfortunately, not many of his novels have been translated from the French into English, despite the fact that he is so prolific (I counted six English translations prior to winning the Nobel Prize in Literature and a further eight since winning).Missing Person appeared to be the perfect starting point for me, as it covered two elements that I am drawn to in literature, noir and philosophy. The novel follows Guy Roland, who was been working for Constantin van Hutte in his detective agency for the past eight years. As Hutte has decided to retire, Roland embarks on one last case, to find out who he really is. Guy Roland (a name given to him by Hutte) lost his memories during the war and is essentially a blank slate.What drew me into this story was the cinematic style; it feels like a French film noir. The French title of the novel is Rue des Boutiques Obscures, which translates to the Street of Dark Shops. This is not a hard-boiled story, as Roland is not hard-boiled in anyway; this is what I would probably call existentialist noir. A perfect blend of the mysterious setting; dark cafes and plenty of wine and cigarettes. With the enhanced feeling of being completely lost, as Roland tries to find out who he really is.“The sand holds the traces of our footsteps but a few moments.”Essentially this is a novel exploring the ideas of identity and memories. I like the way Modiano played with the idea of a blank slate. What defines this person? What makes up this man’s character, and will what defined him in the past return to him? An exploration into the way people remember you and how that shapes your character and personality. Roland tries on different personas; in his investigation he may not discover who he really is but he adopts this ideas of people to see if it feels right or sparks a memory. The way memory plays out in the novel is particularly interesting; in one scene he recalls a love affair with a woman, but fifteen years after the breakup she denies that it ever happened. So you are left wondering if it did happen, or is this a distortion of the truth or maybe even a suppression of her past.This is the type of novel you do not read for the plot. Missing Person is meant to explore an idea, invoke an emotion and get you thinking about identity and memories. The pulp-ish style to this novel really worked for m., I love the idea of investigating yourself; playing with the idea of self-discovery and identity. I will be exploring more from Patrick Modiano; in particular I want to try his novel Honeymoon. I am glad I read Missing Person and I have not been able to stop thinking about the ideas explored in this novel.This review originally appeared on my blog; http://www.knowledgelost.org/book-rev...
88`3`I imagine that Modiano’s British publishers thought long and hard about what title would sell a book whose original title is Rue des Boutiques Obscures. They settled on Missing Person. Not inappropriate, but still, to my mind something is lost in translation here. Vital to this novel is the protagonist’s continuous going to address after address, in his quest after his own lost identity. Until finally, there appears to be only one further address left to go to, in Rome, Via delle Botteghe Oscure, 2. The name of the street implies the hopelessness of the case, and as such, the original title of this book appears to me to be inseparable from its story.And perhaps the title is not all that is lost in translation. Of course, in most cases something is bound to be lost in translation, regardless of the language into which is translated. But this is the type of book intimately connected to the author’s own hermetic, poetic world, and the intonations, rhymes and rhythms of the author’s own language may well be a crucial part of the value of his prose. On the surface, this is a detective story. Furthermore, it is set largely in Paris, which allows for a natural suspense, full of shady streets, foggy riverbanks, men hurrying down streets for fear of being followed, furtive trysts in local cafés obscured by cigarette smoke and such. In addition, the story hails back to the Paris of the second world war, and since some Russian émigrés play a role too, even to the Russian revolution. This adds to the weight and the mystery of the suspense. But the detective story is just a guise. The book can be seen to be about the (vain?) search for identity, the meaninglessness of a single man’s existence (‘I am nothing.’ is the opening sentence). Then there is the war to consider, an obscure father figure… What to make of one’s life, how reliable are our memories? Are we nothing? These might be questions that are somehow tied up in between the lines of this story. For myself, I find I cannot decide what to make of all this. I liked the atmosphere, the look and feel so to say, of the story, and I do not doubt that I am not alone in wanting to find out how it unfolded, although all the while I intuitively felt that in the end not much would unfold, because that is precisely the point. But I cannot help feeling that something of the beauty of the story is in the poetry of the language it was originally written in. That this is the spark needed to help aspire to the bigger questions that lie between or behind the lines. Now, I found it mostly a somewhat strange detective story, that of course ends by leaving the reader clueless.
89`4`I loved this book with its non-aggressive dive into the story, when the interest is growing but at a slower pace allowing sufficient reflection. My instant like of this book, selfishly, was due to mentioning of Georgian last names in first chapters bringing a flick of reality to what I was about to read. Loved every page, loved having unanswered questions and freedom to interpret what happened next... adding other stories by Patrick Modiano to my reading list✨
90`2`I need to stop expecting too much from Nobel winners.
91`2`I only read this because I wanted to read a book in French and it was sitting on the shelf. But I have to say, if this is the quality of the Prix Goncourt winners, I don't want to read any more winners. For one thing, it's not really a novel. It's a movie script; that contemporary cancer on literature whereby writing as if one were describing scenes in a movie is considered literature. Well, it ain't, not in my book anyway.So we have an idea with potential: a guy (the narrator) who's lost his memory and decides to investigate his past, his very identity. He starts his journey when his boss -- a private investigator who'd given him his temporary identity and with whom he was working -- decides to retire. But it's all so superficial and full of cliches (I think he describes his state of mind with the words "with beating heart" like once a page (or at least that's what it seems like)). And then near the end there are a few chapters which are suddenly in the third person, just like that, out of the blue. What's the point of that? If the narrator is the guy who's lost his memory, why suddenly change that for a few chapters? It makes no sense. And to make it worse, he (the writer of this movie-script) is not content to write a simple mystery story (a who-am-i rather than a whodunit), he wants to say "something important", writing things like, what is our life if not half- andbadly-remembered memories that we're not even sure about. Wow? Really?That's, like, deep dude. (Imagine, if you will, the Hollywood version of a Sebald novel...)On the other hand, if you're learning French, it's a good book to read because the language is simple and straightforward.
92`3`I read it in English...titled Missing Person".
93`3`I read the book, but cannot say I recommend it. It is kind of jumpy, going from one scene to the next, but they never quite merge together. I am normally ok with a story involving lots of characters, with seperate plot lines, but this was different. I was also horribly disappointed with the end. I thought, MAYBE it would tie together then, but it certainly didn't & that made me feel like reading the book was somewhat pointless. You do receive brief insights into the missing points of his life, but nothing concrete, nothing pulling it together & nothing that really lets you know which character is speaking at various points. To me, it is too confusing for not enough reward at the end. I do not recommend this book. I gave it 3 stars because the imagery is good & does a good job of placing you in the world he's describing.
94`3`I suppose one can read Patrick Modiano's "Missing Person" as a tale of events occurring to real people. Oh, there are characters, principally the puzzled but eventually accommodating witnesses who help the protagonist Guy Roland in the quest to discover his own identity and past. But whether or not this novel represents the major tendencies of modern French literature, it seems related to the concerns of the other Francophone Nobelists Beckett, Camus and Le Clezio, almost allegorical in nature (although without the struggle between good and evil that so often shapes the medieval version of that genre). What is most important in this writing--speaking here of all four (meaning the small sample of their works that I have read)--is what is missing: a sense of morality, money, shelter, sanity, identity, history, purpose, any place at all where one could be at ease, or, most famously and perhaps a stand-in for it all, the elusive Godot. I emerged from "Missing Person" (with its title that could so easily fit onto a film noir, but with so little of that genre's urgency) thinking that it can be read as a metaphor for post World War II Europe. Not the Europe of the present, with its desperate immigrants, its smaller, wounded economies, its Balkan ghosts, but instead the Europe of the great powers, having lost their empires and their illusions, no longer able to draw the world's borders from London, Paris and Berlin, struggling to determine not who they were but who they are. 
95`3`I took a 10-week course on Rue des Boutiques Obscures at the Alliance de Francaise. The class was entirely in French, but in addition to reading the French version and participating in the French lectures, I simultaneously read the English version, which is titled Missing Person. Both titles say a lot about the overall book. The French title would literally translate to "Avenue of Obscure Shops." While the protagonist does visit a series of peculiar people and places on his search, I believe that this is also a metaphor for the compartmentalization and and obscurity of memory. This subtlety is lost in the English translation, which plays upon the more obvious irony that a detective is searching for a missing person, which is himself. He has amnesia and is searching for his true identity. For an author who has been repeatedly related to Proust, this book is puzzlingly minimalist. My french teacher suggested that Modiano's style is more like Albert Camus, and I must agree. While Proust's prose is rich and lush, I'm vaguely disappointed with Camus and Modiano. They both remind me of a long, sandy beach with random shells of wisdom. The only specific comparison between Proust and Modiano that I've heard is that their books are both war memories (Proust on WWI and Modiano on WWII), but I find this a flimsy reason. It's an interesting experience reading this in French and English. The poetry of the French version is lost in the English version. Despite my struggles of comprehension, the French version was usually a smoother read. However, without the English translation I would have missed some of the finer details. The book often jumps from place to place, and I would have thought that I was missing something that wasn't even in the original. Many of the scenes are highly coincidental and boring, but perhaps I am burned out from reading too many mystery novels as a child. The prose is often broken up by "les fiches," which are police documents sharing a person's personal information: birth, marriage, death, etc. If I had read this just in English, it would have been a quick read and perhaps less obnoxious than closely reading each word. Some of the people mentioned were actually real people in life, such as John Gilbert who was an American actor. This book won the Prix Goncourt in 1978, which is the highest prize for literature in France. Also, Modiano won the Nobel Prize for literature in 2014 for his collected works. As a result, my expectations were probably too high. I prefer big books, and this is a small one. I prefer novels with definite resolution, but this one leaves me with more plot questions than answers. Most of my class was dismayed by the abrupt ending. One woman doggedly insisted that she enjoyed it, but only because she seemed to have given it her own imagined ending. I was relieved that even my teacher wasn't overly thrilled with the novel. 
96`2`I was a bit disappointed. This is the third of his books I've read: Dora Bruder was OK, not something I'd recommend especially. Suspended Sentences, which is very autobiographical, really grabbed me. So much that I had to try to find out about the people he described. Fascinating and with an emotional pull the other two didn't have for me. I would still like to read his autobiography, Pedigree, because I think that would be an extension of Suspended Sentences. Quite an interesting group of characters in his life. Black Marketeers and members of the most notorious gang in Paris during WWII. You couldn't make this up.
97`5`I was just rifling through various commentaries on Modiano and though I could dwell on what others were saying (I was trying to find the book itself, lost among the hundreds of other novels called Missing Person[s]). I noticed quickly he was often described as postmodern. I went to Google to makes sure I knew what postmodern meant, which the definition there described as work that is self-referential.How many of our novelists, past, present and future must be postmodernists? Modiano is certainly self-referential but only to that point at which his imagination takes over and hammers his autobiography into fiction, his crisis of the unknowable poured into a lake of mirrors from which one of his novel drinks from the other.But they are not all alike, and Missing Person stands out as something that is as much existential as it is anything else. It also makes me wonder if Modiano studied Buddhism, because each of his books that I have read offer a painful lesson in attachment. Modiano's attachment/infatuation is often with a mysterious woman (I haven't read many of his novels, but this is certainly true of After the Circus and In the Cafe of Lost Youth).That there is no femme fatale in Missing Person and the protagonist is older makes the story detached from his approach in these other books. In the place of desire we have a detective looking for himself. It's the movie Angel Heart only there are no murders to be discovered and the devil isn't waiting for Guy Roland to recognize his evil nature.Indeed, that is the beauty of Patrick Modiano's Missing Person. It is a journey of discovery where Roland discovers what will remain hidden. Modiano's deceptively simple language pushes us forward, gives us hope, and then... well, you'll just have to read it because this book is worth the time. I feel it may be the finest French novel I've read since Camus' Plague some years back. As far as they other books I've mentioned... well, I'll get back to you soon.
98`4`I was pleasantly surprised by this book! I don't usually read mystery/detective novels, but I found that this one was interesting and engaging. I was unsure throughout the book which fact was "real" and which one was Guy's imagination. It was an interesting way of tackling the subject of amnesia and the search for one's self.
99`4`I've read 2 or 3 books from Modiano before but none of them satisfied me. But i gave this one a try and i'm happy about it.This book was good. I enjoyed reading it. A detective story which is revolving around the charector of the book as he's struggling to find out about his past.
100`2`Interesting but less than effective story about a man searching for his identity. We learn, as he learns, his backstory, as he follows brief memories and the trail of his past. We learn he was one of the many affected by the fall of Paris. As with many of the authors stories, in translated works, this constant use of Parisian addresses is clunky and overdone for those uninitiated to the geography of Paris 
101`2`Interesting setup for a plot, but ultimately ended up being very boring. The main character never really is challenged in discovering his lost identity; everyone he talks to has some kind of clue. Fortunately, it was a short book and I was able to power through it quickly.
102`3`Interesting--A sort of existential detective story (that reminds me a bit about Paul Auster) cast in noir. I liked it better than his later Dora Bruder, though the prose was a bit too sparse for my taste. I'm not sure if it was the translation (which was a bit clumsy in places, like in not distinguishing "farther" and "further" and having too many "skirting"), but it was gripping. Wasn't too sure about the ending, but it was still a good read. Will read more Modiano for sure!
103`4`It is a book that starts with a man who nothing! has no one! tries to find his identity... at the end he again finds his identity and his identity is a man who is nothing! nothing but a pale shape! It`s a story that starts in the same time/place that it ends!(I still don`t understand why people complain about this novel and Patrick Modiano- the winner of Noble prize... this is really a different novel!)Quotes from the book:- I AM NOTHING. Nothing but a pale shape, silhouetted that evening against the café terrace, waiting for the rain to stop;  - Why did a harmless act like dialing a phone number cause me so much anguish?  - She was wearing some highly pungent perfume which reminded me of something. But what?  - "Most of those who called me Styoppa are dead. The others, you can count on the fingers of one hand."  - "I've got lots of photos ... I wrote the names and dates on the back, because one forgets everything ..."  - This scrap of speech which I managed to catch made me feel keenly despondent. Here I was, half-way across a bridge, at night, with a man I did not know, trying to drag some information out of him that would tell me something about myself, and I could not hear him for the noise of trains.  - "My wife's a lot younger than me ... thirty years difference . . . You should never marry a woman a lot younger than you ... Never ..."  - Beauty queens. Gigolos. Butterflies. Most of them, even when alive, had no more substance than steam which will never condense. Hutte, for instance, used to quote the case of a fellow he called "the beach man." This man had spent forty years of his life on beaches or by the sides of swimming pools, chatting pleasantly with summer visitors and rich idlers. He is to be seen, in his bathing costume, in the corners and backgrounds of thousands of holiday snaps, among groups of happy people, but no one knew his name and why he was there. And no one noticed when one day he vanished from the photographs. I did not dare tell Hutte, but I felt that "the beach man" was myself. Though it would not have surprised him if I had confessed it. Hutte was always saying that, in the end, we were all "beach men" and that "the sand" - I am quoting his own words - "keeps the traces of our footsteps only a few moments."  - I stepped forward. Perhaps he would recognize me? Each time, I have the same hope, and each time I am disappointed.  - I said "Freddie" in a different tone of voice, as if it was my own name I was throwing out, after years of having forgotten it.  - "Thanks for giving me these souvenirs." "You're welcome, Mr. McEvoy." I was relieved when she repeated my name, as I had not quite caught it when she first mentioned it. I should have liked to write it down, there and then, but was unsure about the spelling.  - "Can I sit here for a few minutes on my own?"  "Of course."  "It reminds me of 'the good times'..."  - Then Pedro, suddenly said to him: "I think I've found a way of getting out of France . . . With money, everything's possible ..." (money was the reason for him to be a missing person!)  - You were right to tell me that in life it is not the future which counts, but the past.  - I bought a ring for Denise. When I left the shop, the snow was still falling. I was afraid Denise would not be at our meeting place and for the first time it occurred to me that we might lose each other in this town, among all these hurrying shadows. And I no longer remember if, that evening, my name was Jimmy or Pedro, Stern or McEvoy.  - She does not regret having left Paris, five years ago now, after breaking her ankle, when she knew she would never dance again. She decided to leave then, to cut all ties with what had been her life.  - "Tell me, Pedro ... What was your real name? It always intrigued me. Freddie told me your name wasn't Pedro McEvoy . . . But that it was Rubi who had got you false papers..." "My real name? I wish I knew." And I smiled, so that he could take it as a joke.  - "Pedro . . . Before you left I told you you ought to be careful with that fellow..." "What fellow?" "The fellow who was going to get you across into Switzerland ... The Russian with the face of a gigolo ..."  - "Don't you remember... I told you you shouldn't listen to that other one either ... The ski instructor ..." "What ski instructor?" "The one who was going to be your guide... You know... That Bob something... Bob Besson... Why did you go? ... You were all right with us at the chalet..."  - Wrédé returned the following week. We came to an arrangement and discussed the border crossing with him and Besson. Never had Wrédé seemed so warm, so trustworthy. His friendly way of patting you on the shoulder, his pale eyes, his white teeth, his eagerness, all this pleased me, although Gay Orlov had often told me laughingly that you had to be careful with Russians and Poles.  - Very early that morning, Denise and I fastened the straps of our cases. The others were still asleep and we did not want to waken them. I left a note for Freddie. Throughout the journey no one talked. Wrédé seemed nervous.  - It was when Wrédé stopped the car and asked me for the money that I had a vague premonition. I handed him the wads of notes. He counted them. Then he turned round to us and smiled. I would go with Besson, he and Denise with the luggage. We would meet again, in an hour, at his friends' place, on the other side. He kept smiling. A strange smile that I still see in my dreams.  I got out of the car with Besson. Denise sat down in the front, next to Wrédé. I looked at her, and again I had that premonition. I wanted to open the door and tell her to get out.  - I started walking, following Besson. I looked at his back and the marks of his footsteps in the snow. Suddenly, he told me he was going to scout ahead, as we were approaching the border. He told me to wait for him.  After about ten minutes, I realized he was not coming back. Why had I led Denise into this trap? I did my utmost to brush aside the thought that Wrédé would abandon her too and that nothing would be left of either of us.  It kept snowing. I walked on, looking in vain for some landmark. I walked for hours and hours. And finally I lay down in the snow. All around me there was nothing but whiteness.  - I gazed out of the window and tried to recognize the road we were on, but without snow, it looked quite different. The sun on the pines and the meadows, the arching trees overhead, all these different greens surprised me.  "I don't recognize the road," I said to the driver.  "You've been here before?"  "Yes, a long time ago... there was snow on the ground..."  "It's not the same with snow."  - "I knew some people in Megève... I'd very much like to find out what happened to them ... There was this fellow, Bob Besson, for example."  He slowed down and turned to me. "Robert? The instructor?"  "Yes."  He shook his head.  "I went to school with him."  "What happened to him?"  "He's dead. He was killed ski jumping, a few years ago."   '"The Southern Cross'? . . . There are lots of chalets called that..."  Again he offered me the box of lozenges. I took one.  "The chalet jutted out over a road," I said.  "What road?"  Yes, what road? The road I remembered looked like any other mountain road. How could I find it again? And perhaps the chalet was no longer there. And even if it were ...  - I could not sleep, even though there was no more swell. I kept looking through the photographs of us all, Denise, Freddie, Gay Orlov, and gradually they lost their reality, as the boat continued on its way. Had they ever existed?  - Mechanically, I had taken out of my pocket the photographs of us all which I had wanted to show Freddie, and among them the photo of Gay Orlov as a little girl. I had not noticed until then that she was crying. One could tell by the wrinkling of her brows. For a moment, my thoughts transported me far from this lagoon, to the other end of the world, to a seaside resort in Southern Russia where the photo had been taken, long ago. A little girl is returning from the beach, at dusk, with her mother. She is crying for no reason at all, because she would have liked to continue playing. She moves off into the distance. She has already turned the corner of the street, and do not our lives dissolve into the evening as quickly as this grief of childhood? 
104`5`It is ironic that I find myself writing about Patrick Modiano today, when Olga Tokarczuk has been awarded the 2018 Nobel Prize in literature. Modiano was practically unknown in the English speaking world until he won the Nobel Prize in 2014, after which there followed a multitude of translations. Tocarczuk also suffers from lack of Enlgish translations for most of her work. Hopefully the same thing will happen with her as it did with Modiano. Fortunately, I was able tor read Modiano in French. Alas, I don’t know any Polish.This is a superb novel. Modiano’s themes always revolve around identity, memory, Paris under the Nazis. In this work, Guy Roland works for a private detective agency, whose director, Hutte, is retiring. He gives Guy access to all of the agency’s files, directories, connections, and will continue to help him from his retirement. The job is simply for Guy to find out who he is. An unknown accident left Guy with amnesia about a decade earlier. Hutte encountered him, sympathized with his predicament, and offered him a job. Guy now embarks in a voyage of discovery. Modiano is obsessed by the geography of Paris, and Guy moves all over the city, before going abroad. Paris streets are usually described during times of darkness, drizzle, snow, fog, thus creating an atmosphere of anxiety and fear. The story is also foggy at the beginning. As Guy progresses in his work, persons, places, events start emerging from that fog. Connections are made with people, sometimes through detective work, but many times through serendipitous encounters. By the end, Guy has regained memory of a lot of his story: living in Paris during the occupation, having to escape the city, moving with his wife Denise to a small village in Haute-Savoie near the Swiss border. There, two locals convince him that they can easily help him and Denise to cross the Swiss border, for a price, of course. After separating from Denise to presumably facilitate the crossing. Guy is abandoned in a snow storm in the forest. He finally collapses on the snow after trying to find his way. And that marks the end of his memories. Denise disappears forever.But the real question of who Guy is eludes discovery. He has had different names in the past, false identification papers, a fake passport from the Dominican Republic. His inquiry takes him to the South Pacific. His plan is to then go to Rome, since one of the earliest connections had one of his alter-egos living at the “Rue des Boutiques Obscures” in that city. Unfortunately, the fog does not dissipate completely, Maybe it would in the future, but that would have been the subject of a subsequent novel which Modiano did not intend and did not write. 
105`5`It is one thing to search for a missing person in a detective novel and entirely different task to find a missing identity of oneself. And how shocked would some of us be if we would have to go back in our own lives and analyse every decision and relationships like a good detective? Just how lost and (in)significant would any of us seem?Guy Roland is the man who wants to know who is he. During his journey he finds out that most friendships and relationships in general can be reduced to a box of memorabilia. Memories of others and memorabilia is in the end what remains of us when we're gone.Searching who we are in a short time we're here may seem like a very useless task. After all, our lives rarely make huge impacts on the rest of the world. But some journeys should be taken only for the sake of journey, not destination. Patrick Mondiano describes such journey intimately. His style and structure of the story make it a great read which puzzles us and makes us wonder how would our identities look from that same perspective.
106`4`It is such a sparse novel. I have really lost my patience with fat books now. Through it you are trying to grasp at clues along with Guy. Here is an individual who is missing all the building blocks of being a person - cannot even be sure he can recognise himself in a picture. How can you be sure of anything when you don't know who you actually are.
107`3`It seems the greatness of this book is hidden under the surface. And I must admit - I haven't found it. What I was reading was as quite a straightforward detective story in which a guy searches for his past identity - collects clues, talks to people and finally identifies himself with some Pedro who disappeared 10 years ago.What's left of a person after he dies.... Well this is an interesting question, but I don't think the book helps find the answer - the characters lived during the time of war, created fake identities and already made quite some effort to not be recognized (and remembered).To sum it up, I find the idea original, but I don't think it really explores the questions it sets at the beginning. And reading the book as a story, I find it just average.
108`3`It started out pretty good, but towards the end the story line became increasingly fragmented and seemed to lead to no point. At the beginning, I thought of comparisons to Hemmingway, Camus, and Hammet: by the end I was lost. Maybe it's just me, but the Nobel Prize?
109`3`It was a nice read, the language is smooth and comfortable and the story in itself is soothingly mysterious and flows nicely forward. But, the book never really grips me, and even though I stay interested I never really go beyond it.
110`5`Jau atkal mani savaldzināja Modiano noskaņa - un nekādi sižeta "amerikāņu kalniņi", tik vien kā galvenā varoņa sarunas ar paša sameklētiem cilvēkiem, kas varētu palīdzēt restaurēt no atmiņas pazudušo dzīves posmu no savas identitātes meklējumu sākuma punkta "Es neesmu nekas" līdz "Un bez tam man vēl jāveic pēdējais mēģinājums: jāaizbrauc uz Romu - manu bijušo adresi, Tumšo bodīšu ielu 2" - un tas viss Modiano meistarīgā plūstošā teksta nesteidzīgā ritmā ar viscaur esošu Parīzes mīlestības klātesamību. Bauda lēnai lasīšanai Modiano piedāvātajā ritmā.
111`4`Je me suis vite accroché a cette histoire, racontée dans un style simple et avec quelques éléments de mystère.Si vous aimez bien Paris, ce serait intéressant de parcourir les mêmes chemins du le roman et comparer ce qui vous inspirent les rues et ce que raconte le personnage des mêmes rues. J'ai bien aimé ce roman, malgré les choses tristes qui se passent dedans et qui ne sont pas décrites avec des détails, de façon morbide, parce que c'est plutôt a vous de les imaginer.Je dois ajouter aussi, que même si l'on dit qu'on ne doit pas faire attention aux images des couvertures, je suis tombé amoureux de l'illustration de cette édition, et je trouve qu'elle décrit bien un des aspects du roman.
112`null`Je ne suis rienModiano modulates the starkness of that statement straight away. "I am nothing. Nothing but a pale silhouette that evening, on the terrace of a café. I was waiting for the rain to stop, a downpour that had started the moment Hutte left me." That switch, from a general statement, I am nothing, to a particular occasion, on the terrace of a café, but a generic, unnamed café, not a specific one (and how can a silhouette be pale?); the switch to the past tense, but not the historic past, no, the imperfect, a tense used for regular re-occurring events, or for the unfinished...; and then the intentionality of the weather, rain that can seemingly wait until the moment Hutte leaves to start its symbolic downpour, all these subtly handled modulations combine to take this narrative out of the mundane, the banal, the realistic world, into some dream-like place. Right from the start, I felt less that I was reading and decoding, than that meaning was being planted by an unseen hand in my mind.To relay the story itself is simple: Guy Roland was given that name, and papers to go with it, as a convenience: in fact he has no memory of who he is at all, no identity, none. Je ne suis rien. For years he has worked together with Hutte as a private investigator. Now that Hutte is retiring to the South of France, Roland decides to make use of the office resources and contacts to research into his own past. The identities that he uncovers, the story he finds (or invents?), are all dubious themselves, counterfeit names and papers opening out like nesting Russian dolls into more falsity and deception. Roland ends by identifying with one character, but whether the story that brings everyone together is really his past or one that he has invented is never known, and, in the end, is immaterial.So, it might appear that this is the roman policier version of Modiano's obsessions. I bought this (yes, I caved already, I bought a new book) in one of those rare and precious places, a really good bookshop with staff that can help and give advice. There was a big display of Modiano - didn't realize he'd written so much! - so I asked the nice lady where she thought I should start? Well, says she, his books offer variations on a theme, so she recommended that I should, at the very least, buy the special edition of Le Magazine Littéraire dedicated to the man, and check through the list of works with summaries in there, or just take a look at the back covers, and pick what appealed. There were several that dealt with loss of identity, search for identity, with puzzles, and putting together the fragments of a life. I read that Modiano was born in 1945, the day after Liberation. I read that Modiano's father, himself Jewish, had refused to register as a Jew or wear the yellow star under Occupation, effectively denying his identity, and even collaborating with the occupying forces. Survival by breaking with your past, by creating a new persona. The father who then left the family. Ghosts of Modiano's past that he is trying to lay, variations on that theme?But such a reading would be reductive in the extreme. For Modiano creates one of those magical worlds that are both real and not, both concrete and symbolic, both of a particular individual and of all mankind. The search that goes beyond a name or an address or a date of birth, the search that creates connections, follows relationships, is also the search of the writer for a story, building the tree of narrative from tiny seeds. And also the story of reading, to forget yourself and identify with another, to take on his personality and his story and feel his pain, share his fate, make his mistakes.There are leitmotifs that run through this novel, and may be typical of Modiano, even Le Magazine Littéraire comments on a striking homogeneity in his work, which might well be politespeak for always the same. Keys: a fascination with keys turning in locks; cigar boxes, biscuit tins that contain photos, tickets, scraps, the collected leftovers of a life; and yearbooks, or telephone books, or registers of everyone who ever lived at an address, reverse telephone books, in any case something that in French were called Bottins (?) - no idea really, but they would appear to be a convenient precursor of internet research, very handy for private investigators.I think this most reminded me of Saramago, that real world that carries symbolic weight. I need to re-read All the Names. Yes. I'd like to read more Modiano. See what austerity allows.
113`3`Jedna z knih, která je hezky napsaná, takže ji nemůžete náležitě ztrestat, ale je strašně o hovnu, takže vás vlastně nezajímá. Taky vlastně nemůžete říct, jestli je o hovnu, protože pak si v doslovu přečtete, že je vlastně o samotě, vykořistění a bytí, takže jste zmatení, jestli teda rozumíte literatuře nebo ne. Co jsem si z knihy odnesl tak tedy vlastně akorát to, že když pátráte po své minulosti, každý člověk kterého potkáte Vás náhodou kdysi znal, když se ho zeptáte na fotky tak vám s radostí věnuje všechny svoje rodinné fotografie a ještě vás pozve do bytu na kávičku. Za největší kámen úrazu, když nepočítám děj posouvaný nesmyslnými náhodami, ale považuji fakt, že i když se kniha z větší části odehrává během druhé světové války tak v ní není ani jeden tank a ani jedna stíhačka.
114`3`Jornal Público - ípsilon"Também a mãe esteve muito pouco presente na sua infância e adolescência, o que o aproximou ainda mais do seu irmão Rudy, dois anos mais novo, com quem viveu em Paris na casa dos avós maternos. A morte do irmão, com apenas seis anos, destruiu definitivamente a infância de Patrick Modiano e fará com que os temas da perda, da ausência, do vazio, da identidade fragmentada, venham a ser dominantes na sua obra literária."(«O Nobel da Literatura premiou a "música discreta" de Patrick Modiano», Luís Miguel Queirós e Cláudia Lima Carvalho - 9 de Outubro de 2014)"Estava agora nevoeiro, um nevoeiro ao mesmo tempo doce e gélido, que nos enchia os pulmões de tal fresco que tínhamos a sensação de flutuar no ar."(Capítulo IV)"Acredito que se ouve ainda nas entradas dos prédios o eco dos passos dos que costumavam atravessá-las e entretanto desapareceram.

115`2`Just 2 stars for the pain and disappointment this book caused. Nobel prize? New Proust? I just don't get it. Modiano's writing is smth that I just don't enjoy. And Marcel Proust I reead and reread severeal times, but this even twice ( in diff translations) too migraine enducing to my taste.
116`4`Just a glampse into the 40’s. You can almost feel the incertitude, the fear of those years no matter what you do, guilty or innocent.
117`4`Kafka-esque at times - a man searching for himself among strangers who might be friends, with people giving him momentos which might be shared memories. Nice metaphor for those who lived in France under the Nazis, wondering what to do with that collective guilt/anxiety.
118`3`Khó đọc và gây nản.Phải chăng vì là văn học của tác giả Nobel nên kẻ phàm phu không thể lĩnh hội?Xuyên suốt 226 trang đầu là những mơ hồ, có phần khó hiểu và ngắt liên tục tạo cảm giác hụt hẫng, chẳng biết mình đang đọc cái gì. Thế rồi 30 trang cuối giải thích ngắn gọn và chiếu đèn sáng rọi cả một "khu phố u ám" trong lòng nhân vật chính - Guy - kẻ đến quá khứ của mình cũng lãng quên để rồi lọ mọ đi tìm lời giải.Chả biết nữa. Đọc cuốn nào của Patrick Modiano cũng khó hiểu. Có điều cuốn này thì càng suy nghĩ càng chả hiểu gì cả. Người gì đâu văn chương cứ toát ra vẻ buồn, u ám, cô độc, khắc khoải và tối tăm đến vậy.Vậy ra những cuốn của nhà văn này mà đã xuất bản ở VN thì chỉ có cuốn "Từ thăm thẳm lãng quên" là nuốt trôi không nghẹn.
119`4`L' argomento principale di questo libro sono i ricordi.E così comincerò con uno mio:La prima volta che sono stata a Roma, avevo circa sei o sette anni non di più, adoravo camminare e guardare due cose (abitudine che fra l' altro non ho più perso): 1. I nomi e cognomi delle persone sulle targhette dei citofoni.2. I nomi delle vie.Così capitò che un giorno camminando camminando alzai lo sguardo sulla targa di una via ad un angolo di strada, si era dietro piazza Venezia, e lessi "via delle Botteghe Oscure" chissà perchè nella mia testa si formò la precisa idea che vi fossero da qualche parte botteghe di alchimisti o maghi (l' influenza di Harry Potter si faceva sentire) naturalmente chiesi subito delucidazioni ai miei genitori che ridacchiando risposerò che la cosa più "oscura" che c'era stata in quella via non erano di certo botteghe di arti magiche, ma tutt'al più la sede del PCI al civico 5. Dove mio padre, ridacchiando, mi disse "Erano soliti mangiare bambini" (come se non mi fossi accorta che mi stava prendendo in giro).Detti per buona la loro versione ma segretamente continuai a credere nella mia, sicurissima che loro non fossero a conoscenza di tali botteghe perchè "babbani".Al quinto anno di liceo stavo studiando Bassani e mi reimbatto di nuovo in questo nome e in questa via, il che ha riportato a galla questo ricordo da tempo archiviato d' infanzia. Cosicché oggi me ne sia potuta ricordare e lo abbia potuto riportare fedelmente qui.I ricordi però sono proprio la cosa che manca totalmente al protagonista del romanzo Pedro McAvoy Stern, affetto da un amnesia retrograda, che non si ricorda nemmeno di portare questo nome all' inizio del romanzo, e che dovrà annaspare fino a metà del libro per poterlo riacquistare. Intanto lavora in una agenzia investigativa privata insieme al “bello e biondo barone baltico Costantino von Hutte” che diventerà anche un suo caro amico. Tanto da aiutarlo nelle indagini per ritrovare se stesso.Pedro è l' unico a non vivere e nutrirsi di ricordi in una Parigi i cui abitanti vivono praticamente nel passato, tanto da non riuscire a venirne fuori nel presente. E tutto ciò che gli resta del suo di passato, invece, è un indirizzo "via delle Botteghe Oscure 2".Secondo la mia esperienza personale, e per una mia strana forma di sensibilità Modiano è uno scrittore particolarmente notturno ,vale a dire che, bisognerebbe leggerlo di notte, meglio mentre si sta scivolando nel sonno gli si adatta particolarmente quel labilissimo confine fra sogno e veglia che somiglia così tanto a quello che lui vuole tracciare fra ricordo e realtà nei suoi romanzi, in cui finiscono per fondersi, tanto che non ci sono stacchi precisi fra l' uno e l' altro e mi sono spesso ritrovata a dover rileggere un paio di volte per capire se fosse il presente (del libro) quello che stavo leggendo o il passato.
120`4`La calidad de Modiano empieza con dudas en las primeras páginas, pero el texto toma velocidad a partir de la mitad. Cuando muchas preguntas de Guy se han resuelto la obra toma curso y se enfoca hacia un rápido final que lo deja a uno con ganas de más páginas y le da a Modiano el beneficio de la duda para despejarlo en otro libro del autor. La estructura de la historia es un poco monótona al principio, pero cuando las cartas se destapan todo mejora. Lo mejor de todo son algunos diálogos, con frases acertadas y satíricas que le deseprende una sonrisa al lector.
121`4`La perte de mémoire comme moteur d'une enquête policière dans une atmosphère très mélancolique. Un livre sur l'oubli. Et curiéusement, une des raisons pour lesquelles je l'ai bien aimé c'est puisque l'histoire, qui se déroule presque entièrement à Paris, m'a rappelé plein d'endroits où je me suis baladé dans un passé lointain.
122`3`La simple évocation du nom de MODIANO convoque toute une idée de la littérature des quarante dernières années. _Rue des Boutiques Obscures_ est certainement l’un de ses romans les plus connus, peut-être parce qu’il fut couronné par le prix Goncourt en 1978.Si je devais qualifier ce roman sur le fond en quelques mots, je dirais: quête identitaire, mémoire, disparition et mystère.> Non, il ne m’avait pas reconnu. Personne ne me reconnaissait.Sur la forme je dirais: toponymie, musicalité, originalité et virtuosité.> Une petite fille rentre de la plage, au crépuscule, avec sa mère. Elle pleure pour rien, parce qu’elle aurait voulu continuer de jouer. Elle s’éloigne. Elle a déjà tourné le coin de la rue, et nos vies ne sont-elles pas aussi rapides à se dissiper dans le soir que ce chagrin d’enfant ?Tout n’est pas dit, certains éléments ne sont qu’évoqués pour mieux laisser l’imagination du lecteur faire son ouvrage. Je pense qu’une première lecture n’est pas suffisante pour que le roman livre tous ses secrets. C’est pour cette raison que je ne vais pas en dire plus et que le relirai certainement avec, je l’espère et je le crois, toujours autant de plaisir.http://aubonroman.com/2017/12/rue-des...
123`4`Lembrei-me da ópera "A Mulher Sem Sombra" de R. Strauss quando comecei a ler este livro de Modiano. Aqui, o protagonista é um "homem sem sombra", um homem que perdeu a memória e que não sabe nada sobre si próprio, a começar pelo seu nome. Decide lançar-se numa perseguição detetivesca sobre o seu passado, mas com um pudor e uma timidez notáveis, e acaba por descobrir que a sua busca é inútil, como o choro de uma criança: "Chora sem motivo, ou porque queria continuar a brincar. Afasta-se. Já dobrou a esquina da rua - e não se dissiparão, ao anoitecer, as nossas vidas, tão depressa como aquele gesto de criança?"O livro vale sobretudo pela escrita, calma e distanciada, como se envolvesse o enredo numa névoa, a névoa da memória, e pelo desfilar de uma série de personagens, excecionalmente bem delineados, por vezes apenas com alguns traços, que vão surgindo ao longo do périplo do narrador (estou a lembrar-me do fotógrafo efeminado e paranóico, Mansoure, que morava num apartamento repleto de "cetins, marfins e dourados um pouco enjoativos" e afastava constantemente as cortinas, desconfiando de alguém escondido). 
124`3`Libro che ha richiesto tutta la mia attenzione e credo tutt'ora che non tutti i tasselli di questa storia siano del tutto chiari per me. Un ex investigatore privato, va alla ricerca delle proprie tracce, del proprio passato e della propria identità. Siamo a Parigi, attraverso sensazioni, chiedendo informazioni, gli vengono regalate foto, dati indirizzi, che lui scrupolosamente verifica da buon investigatore. E come scritto poco fa io in questa marea di nomi e vie francesi dopo un po non ci ho capito più niente e ho avuto la sensazione di perdermi con il protagonista, di non riuscire a districarmi tra queste pagine e di perdermi nelle vie di Parigi..
125`5`Like his extraordinary book Dans le café de la jeunesse perdue, the main character begins as a mystery. In each book, detail by detail this person is revealed, but still a great deal of mystery remains. When I read both of these books it seemed that they were enveloped in fog and darkness and nothing was ever clear. The writing is beautiful (I read them in French) and evocative, like this sentence: "In life it is not the future which counts, but the past."
126`3`Like the other book I read by Modiano, The Black Notebook, this book has a strong noir-ish feel. One imagines the movie to be made of it as certainly black and white. And while Notebook was about a guy trying to remember or relive a relationship of years earlier, Missing Person has the main character, who suffers from amnesia about an era of his past, attempting to reconstruct who he is and what he did. So he is the Missing Person. So ultimately a mystery novel. While it takes place in the early 60's, he is trying to reconstruct France around WWII when the country is occupied or about to be by the germans, but is peopled by all sorts of characters from many countries all on the move to try to be safe. The story itself becomes increasingly interesting as his meetings with people who knew him (or didn't) initially seem to lead nowhere, but slowly does come together. And as the clues come together he starts to remember his past. Spoiler alert: what he ultimately remembers is fairly horrific. So Modiano is for someone in the mood for a very tight, very focused, very well written story. Not for laughs. 
127`2`Lugemisklubi protokoll lisatudMM – hinne 3Oli huvitav raamat, pean tunnistama, et olin eelnevalt kuulnud piinlevat kaaslast ja sestap kerge eelarvamus oli kujunenud. Ent lugesin siiski järjest äbi.Noh, mis ma oskan öelda. See lugu oli minu jaoks päris huvitavalt ülesehitatud, tagasipōigetega kulgev liin meeldis. Aegajalt tekkisid paralleelid Nemirovitš-Dantšenko raamatuga, kuid see teos kahvatus võrlduses.

128`5`Lần đầu biết đến Patrick Modiano qua lời giới thiệu của một người bạn. Anh ấy nói : " Khó hiểu lắm anh thề luôn " và mình bật cười đáp lại " ok, vậy để em đọc ". Kỳ lạ là câu chữ của ông thật cuốn hút và mình nghĩ nó kén người đọc. Phải rồi, bạn phải thật tập trung và cái hay xuất hiện trong từng chi tiết, khó hiểu nhưng không phải là không thể hiểu, trừu tượng như nghệ thuật. Nếu mĩ thuật diễn tả nhân văn qua hình ảnh thì Patrick Modiano diễn ta nhân văn qua con chữ. Nên ta không cần băn khoăn về sự khó hiểu của văn phong hay lối diễn đạt, lại càng không thể tìm cách diễn đạt tương đương cho những câu chữ đó.“ Ở đó, dưới hàng cây của bờ ke, tôi có cảm giác khó chịu là mình đang mơ. Tôi đã sống dứt cuộc đời của mình và tôi chỉ còn là một hồn ma trở lại chập chờn trong không khí ấm áp tối thứ Bảy. Tại sao còn muốn nối lại những sợi dây đã đứt và tìm những lối qua đã bít kín từ lâu.” TríchMột cuốn sách văn học nhưng lại chứa đựng giá trị tri thức quá cao ! Cảm ơn Patrick Modiano.
129`4`Lần đầu đọc là bản cũ, giấy siêu xấu của NXB Văn Học, 4 năm sau đọc lại bản mới của Nhã Nam.Cảm giác những nhân vật trong sách của Modiano di chuyển rất nhiều, dù chỉ trong phạm vi khá nhỏ hẹp, họ cũng tìm kiếm rất nhiều, dù chẳng thấy được điều họ muốn, họ cũng gặp gỡ rất nhiều, nhưng người cần gặp đã vụt khỏi tầm tay.Cuốn sách buồn bã mà không u uất, có gì đó rất nên thơ, dù cuộc đời nhân vật chính đầy sóng gió nhưng vẫn mang cho tôi cảm giác gì rất dễ chịu, êm đềm.
130`2`Man seeks facts about his past.Search takes him to numerous "colorful" characters and "vivid" locales, or so rendered in Modiano's prose.Man finds (mostly) the facts of his past.It doesn't fucking matter.
131`4`Me acuerdo de un momento en que estaba escuchando un episodio de podcast sobre jirafas (!) y en una tanda que metieron en el medio me quedé pensando sobre si alguna vez había visto una y no me quedaba claro. Cuando volvieron uno de los conductores le preguntó al otro justamente si había visto una jirafa alguna vez, y éste respondió que no sabía, que después de cierto punto/edad la memoria te puede jugar malas pasadas y no sabés si cierta imagen fue una vivencia real o algo que viste por ahí en una foto o en TV.Si dijera que ésta es una historia sobre memoria e identidad parecería que acabo de hacer un copy-paste de wikipedia, pero creo que es lo mismo que diría cualquiera después de haberla leído porque los conceptos están a la vista. El protagonista es un detective sin memoria de su pasado antiguo que decide investigar quién era y qué hacía antes de trabajar en la agencia diez años atrás. La investigación trae cajas sacadas de algún armario que se desempolvan, nombres de personas que ya no vienen por acá, fotos con anotaciones, documentos que aparecen escritos textualmente. Y entonces empiezan a emerger los recuerdos, y ahí es donde Modiano tiene un don o bien una técnica que no puedo explicar bien para darle un halo de ensueño mnémico (?) a todo que me resulta lo más destacable de su escritura. Es como que en vez de racontos llegaran detalles, o bien momentos individualizados que no parecen tener importancia salvo para quien los vivió. Una sonrisa fugaz en una despedida, una tarde con amigos tomando vino...Me impresionó bastante como el protagonista, que va de a poco apropiándose de los recuerdos de una persona que él cree ser, de repente pega un salto y se pasa a otro con otros recuerdos. Los narradores no-confiables ya son moneda común, pero una primera persona dudosa es algo que nunca me había cruzado.De entre los recuerdos surge una especie de traición, una trampa y una especie de víctima. La verdad no leí esta novela pensando en la guerra, y después escuché por ahí que Modiano suele aproximarse a la guerra/ocupación de forma alegórica...Creo que el libro tiene la capacidad de aceptar diferentes recorridos o experiencias para diferentes lectores. Más que una historia lineal lo veo como una figura que parte de un punto insignificante ("Je ne suis rien" dice la primera línea) y se expande en diferentes direcciones para terminar difuminándose... A mí me dejó pensando sobre la posibilidad de dejar atrás alguien que fuimos y ya no nos simpatiza.
132`3`Missing Person begins as a detective story—a now-retired private eye looks to explain a decades-long gap in his own memories—but then evolves into a larger meditation on the relation between memory and life as the protagonist begins to recall the events that befell him during the war. The message seems to be something about the fractured nature of our lives, but it is muddled both by the book’s short length and by the French cultural background that I don’t have. There is beautiful writing here, but it is left to the reader to convince himself that it is interesting.
133`4`Missing Person by Patrick Modiano tells of a man’s attempt to recover an entire period of his life that has been forgotten. Hazy, mysterious, and depressing, Modiano’s novel is not just about the search for the self but how it is affected by memory, the lifetime of flashy reminiscences that one accumulates as life continues. Guy Roland’s (the protagonist’s) inability to recollect illuminates the concept of memory, which is already normally a fickle thing. Guy’s tragic situation is unique; sometime within the last decade, he lost all memories of his past. As he follows leads and moves from street to street in France, the concept of memory accompanies him throughout, even if he doesn’t have it. In particular, there are a few major divergent points in the novel that serve to illustrate what a funny thing memory is. The majority of the book is narrated through Guy’s first person perspective, but there are 3 notable chapters that aren’t.Chapter 26 is told in third person limited perspective. A man is walking home with his young son as he does every day when he is struck by the word “Castille” on a book in a bookstore he passes by. This single word suddenly conjures a memory of meeting Pedro (Guy’s previous name) in the Hotel Castille. It calls to his mind the task that this man helped Pedro with, along with Pedro’s clear desperation as they met for the second and final time. Guy also recalls this same man and time at a different point in the novel. Chapter 43 is similarly told in the third person limited perspective. A woman sees children playing and they call out “Pedro”. This recalls her memory of meeting a man named Pedro, whom she knew through Denise. Oftentimes, memories are evoked by random and otherwise nonsignificant triggers in our environment. Though it had been about 20+ years, the man in Chapter 26 simply sees the word “Castille” and he easily recalls his interactions with someone he had met only briefly and long ago. Further, he remembers the impression Pedro made on him and for a moment, he devotes a bit of time to dwell upon someone who is lost (missing). Similarly, the woman in Chapter 43 suddenly remembers Pedro because she hears someone else called this name.Chapter 32 is again told in third person limited perspective. A woman is on the tram and recollects a memory that comes to her regularly. She remembers a particular day she spent with her godmother, Denise, and a gentleman that Denise takes along (Pedro). She remembers what they did during that day but doesn’t remember anything else about these two people. Guy also recalls this same person and time at a different point in the novel.For many, there are some memories that are replayed with details that are still quite clear. Sometimes, this happens when the memory holds a personal significance. However, this can also happen with memories that don’t hold special significance, yet we may remember them distinctly and/or regularly. These really illustrate how arbitrary memories can be, and though the woman in Chapter 32 isn’t aware, she is, in a way, regularly paying a sort of regard for someone who is missing (Pedro) and someone who has likely passed away (Denise).Aside from memories that are housed in our own and other’s minds, they are also captured in physical objects outside our own heads. As Guy interviews person after person and tries to draw out their memories that might help him continue his investigation, he also often receives tokens of remembrances from many he meets. These come in the form of photos, a postcard, books, a diary, a note, a magazine, and these items symbolize the memories of those who gave them to Guy. These souvenirs capture the owners’ personal emotions tied to these items: loss, love, friendship. An even less personal preservation of the past can be found in the yearbooks and directories that Guy consults in his previous employer’s office, in addition to the resources that a colleague consults to provide Guy with additional information about the people and names he finds during his investigation. These, along with the previously mentioned personal memories, must be put together by Guy’s professional private investigative eye to reconstruct the story of his past.Navigating the disconnected and hazy remembrances of Guy as he tries to recapture his cloudy past can remind one of times when we try to capture our own recollections of our own pasts. Sometimes, we remember with great detail. Sometimes, our recollections aren’t accurate. Other times, we don’t remember at all. As Guy tells his previous employer, Hutte, “in life it is not about the future which counts, but the past”. Despite the imperfect nature of memory, the prevailing obsession in the novel with piecing together the past is highly significant but also immensely tragic.There are several sayings about how we must remember and learn from the past in order to move forward into the future. However, most of Guy’s friends and acquaintances of his past who may be able to tell him much more about his old life have died or cannot be immediately found. There is no clear resolution at the end of the novel and Guy’s search seems like it could be endless. For Guy, there is no moving from the past and it seems likely that he’ll continue his search endlessly. Perhaps there is no redemption to be found in the endless replays of our own minds of the past. What Missing Person shows readers is that it’s not as much whether or not we can remember, but that the past is inescapable. 
134`2`Modiano has a thing with people obsessed by the past, or better, their personal past. In this novel a certain Guy Roland is looking for who he really is, 10 years after he lost his memory. His quest brings him to a dozen of people, one after the other, by association. And every time he thinks : “ah, maybe I am this person, or no, perhaps I am that one”. Gradually pieces of memories come back and eventually he can put a name and a face on the man he used to be and on the people he lived with (typically for Modiano also the second world war plays a part). But Modiano also subtly hints these memories probably aren’t really trustworthy. And the list of people Guy should contact, keeps on growing; in the end you have the feeling he is never going to find a definitive answer who he was before his amnesia.And – according to me – that is the message Modiano has put in this novel: the past is a phantom you never really can grasp, like an horizon that always recedes. This sounds very pessimistic, because it means you never can catch your own identity, know who you really are or where you come from. At the beginning of the novel a friend of Guy advises him: “il faut vivre au present” (you have to live in the present), which is bluntly true, but together with Modiano we have to notice that people keep on clinging to the past. Maybe that’s one of the fundamentals of being human?Modiano keeps on amazing: it is as though he consciously does not want to be a spectacular writer; he keeps on writing about “little” people (no heroes) in a very concrete setting (especially Paris), in a simple and smooth style, very likable but not exceptional. I'm starting to like him (his French also is very readable!).
135`5`Modiano was awarded the Prix Goncourt for "Missing Person" more than 30 years ago but the novel reads as fresh as if it had been written yesterday. It begins portentously with the sentence: "I am nothing." This early work is not only constructed like a detective tale, but the narrator is a detective. Guy Roland, which may or may not be the narrator’s real name, has worked at a detective agency under the direction of his boss, Hutte, for over eight years. Guy is suffering from amnesia and when he went to work at the agency Hutte provided him with papers to back up his adopted name and identity. It is only after his boss retires, and he is freed from labor, that he can take on the task of finding himself. (Spoiler alert, of sorts)Naturally this involves an investigation. At first Guy is led to believe, mistakenly, that he may be a man called Freddie Howard de Luz. However, in time his research leads him to believe his real name may be Jimmy Pedro Stern, and he may have been born in Greece. But subsequently, some evidence indicates that his real name and identity might be Pedro McEvoy and he might be from the Dominican Republic. If he is Stern he disappeared in 1940. If he is McEvoy he left France before the war.In seeking his past, the narrator rounds up the usual (Modiano) suspects for questioning: names, addresses, old photos, telephone numbers. "Missing Person" is a slim book of just over 150 pages, in which more characters—no fewer than 22—make an appearance than in many novels twice the length and not an insignificant number of whom have died or committed suicide: CM Hutte (formerly known as The Baltic Baron, Constantin von Hutte): the detective for whom the narrator worked and who gave him the name Guy Roland Styoppa de Dzhagorev: a Russian who gives the narrator a red box with memoriesOld Giorgiadze: Gay Orlov’s grandfatherGay Orlov: granddaughter of Dzhagoreve, commits suicide to avoid getting old (Galina Gay Orloff was, according to Modiano in his memoir "Pedigree", one of his fathers’ girlfriends; she took her life on February 12, 1948)Waldo Blunt: pianist, Gay Orlov’s first husbandRobert (Bob): the groundskeeper at the former château of Freddie Howard de Luz who gives Guy a biscuit box full of little things he was able to put aside Howard de Luz (Jean Simety): confident of the American actor John GilbertFreddie Howard de Luz: the narrator’s friend, marries Gay Orlov, disappears in the South PacificDenise Yvette Courdreuse: a former model and eventually the narrator’s wife, vanishes in the snow while trying to cross the Franco-Swiss border (Kidnapped? Killed? Left to freeze to death?) Proprietor, or waiter, at the café A la Marine: gives Guy a magazine with a picture of Denise CourdreuseJean-Michel Mansoure: the photographer who took Denise’s picture and provides Guy with a copy of Alexander Scouffi’s book, as well as pictures of him, and listens to the voice of the Blue Rider on a party lineAlexander (Alec) Scouffi: a man of letters and an author, murdered by the Blue RiderBlue Rider: a vile little rotter, the murderer Alexander ScouffiPedro McEvory: a Dominican subject working at the Dominican legation in ParisLouis De Wrédé, Oleg (Comte de Montpensier): a blackguard who preys on people of both sexes, possibly a former Nazi collaborator E Kahan: a female correspondent who provides information about Oleg De WrédéJimmy Pedro Stern: a Greek, possibly the narrator (Guy)André Wildmer: an English jockey and friend of Freddie Howard de Luz Porfirio Rubirosa: a Dominican diplomat who could procure false papers, killed in a car accidentBob Besson: a ski instructor; dies in a skiing accidentVan Allen: owner of a fashion house where Denise workedKyril: a Russian who traded in cans of paint and aluminum and knows people at the Comet GarageIn his search to discover who he is, Guy works by intuition, premonition, supposition, and dream-like imaginings. He constantly hypothesizes about peoples’ motives and behavior. The often disparate details he uncovers serve as his Ariadne’s thread—one he hopes will lead him to himself. But even when he feels he is making some progress, he acknowledges when he feels stymied and baffled "…Scraps, shreds have come to light as a result of my searches…But then that is perhaps what a life amounts to…Is it really my life I’m tracking down? Or someone else’s into which I have somehow infiltrated myself?"Guy believes that places hold traces of the lives that have lived there: "I believe that the entrance-halls of buildings still retain the echo of footsteps of those who used to cross them and who have since vanished. Something continues to vibrate after they have gone, fading waves, but which can still be picked up if one listens carefully." Yet, despite his persistent attempts to raise clues from the locations he visits, physical reality, the places themselves, resist his efforts. When Guy discovers that he and his girlfriend at the time, Denise Courdreuse, might have been living in the same building in which the Blue Rider murdered Scouffi, he ponders: "An event as tragic as this must surely have left some trace, if we had lived through it on the floor below. But, he concedes: Not a trace of it in my memory."Guy follows a number of leads in his search for himself. Early on, the Russian Styoppa de Dzhagorev gives him a red box containing mementos and keepsakes, photographs and newspaper clippings of the past that might be useful in his search. Later on, Guy visits the former villa of Freddie Howard de Luz, whom he thinks may have been a childhood friend. Bob, the groundskeeper whom he interrogates, gives him useful information, and before Guy leaves, Bob gives him a box of full of Freddies’ keepsakes and mementos that he had put aside before everything else in the villa was impounded. Guy notes, sadly: "It certainly seemed everything ended with old chocolate or biscuit or cigar boxes." Finally, his investigation leads him to conclude that he and Denise were probably victims of a double-cross in an attempt to cross the Franco-Swiss border in the winter, during the waning days of the war. At any rate, that is where Denise disappears. It may also be where he, too, disappeared. The trauma of being tricked and abandoned in the mountains in the cold, and left to die, may have been the traumatic event that produced his amnesia. None of this is ever confirmed. Denise’s physical whereabouts remain unknown, but thanks to Guy’s work she now has a name and a history. In the end, Guy is physically present, but despite his best investigative efforts, he remains a missing person with no verifiable name or history. He may be Jimmy Pedro Stern or he may be Pedro McEvoy. Or he may be neither. Or, it may be, as he says in the beginning of the novel, "I am nothing."See me complete review of Modiano at: https://lareviewofbooks.org/essay/the...
136`4`Modiano è un premio Nobel ed è comunque sempre corroborante leggere un Nobel, comunque lo si valuti è sempre il premio letterario più internazionale o discusso.Prima del Nobel Modiano mi era perfetto sconosciuto, se gli altri suoi scritti assomigliano a Rue Des Boutiques Obscures credo che il riconoscimento sia meritato perché questo libro ha una sua grazia, una sua eleganza nello stile, un sapore nostalgico, un senso di enigma che lo fa, seppur molto lontanamente, avvicinare ad un giallo, restituisce una atmosfera che svapora in una foschia leggera che avvolge la storia e che è molto calamitante.La motivazione al premio gli viene dal suo essere cantore della memoria e decisamente è un libro sulla memoria.Il protagonsta è Guy Roland, dieci anni prima è incorso in una amnesia patologica che non gli permette di ricordare il suo passato più remoto, vive come immerso in una nebbia esistenziale e vuole riprendere le fila delle sua vita passata.Per poter continuare a esistere nel consorzio civile deve disporre di una identità angrafica che gli viene assegnata, ma fittizia.Paradossalmente comincia a lavorare in un’agenzia di investigazioni private dove impara l’arte dell’indagine e ha l’opportunità di avere a disposizione strumenti preziosi per poter fare ricerche di e su persone, portare alla luce situazioni delicate, dispone di archivi, di elenchi numerici, di nomi, schede anagrafiche dettagliate, annuari e sa muoversi con grande dimestichezza tra consolati e ambasciate.Finisce per applicare a se stesso il procedimento di lavoro che applica ai suoi clienti: fa un viaggio a ritroso nella sua memoria muta e silenziosa cercando di mettere insieme indizi sparsi, labili intuizioni, immagini vaghe come una insegna di un locale, la facciata di un palazzo, l’atmosfera di un quartiere di Parigi l’angolo di una via, odori profumi suoni, voci.Guarda foto, vecchie di decenni, e vede un uomo alto che vagamente gli somiglia, fruga nella memoria, la strapazza cercando collegamenti e associazioni che non vengono, gli pare di riconoscersi ma non ne è affatto sicuro e la certezza (ma quale certezza!) gli può venire solo da testimonianze altrui.A volte sembra essere sulla buona pista, la sua identità quasi svelarglisi ma, proprio quando il mosaico comincia a ricomporsi e lui ad affezionarsi alla nuova esistenza, ecco che una prova, una testimonianza, un dato nuovo, demolisce il fragile castello di carte.Ma andare a rimuovere le acque del passato è cosa buona e giusta? Perché risvegliare cose che l’amnesia ha confinato nel proprio torpore e che potrebbero rivelarsi dolorose, ritrovare le bon temps e se non fosse un bon temps?Non guardate al passato ma solo all’avvenire à partir de maintenant ne regardez plus in arrière et pensez au presente et a l’avenir, un monito per Guy Roland ma anche per tutti, non preda di amnesie patologiche.Perché anche noi talvolta abbiamo bisogno di essere rassicurati su chi siamo, e che qualcuno ci dica che non siamo ciò che in quel momento crediamo di essere (uno schifo o una meraviglia), che siamo invece meglio o peggio dell’immagine (non fisica) che lo specchio dell’umore ci riflette, l’idea che abbiamo di noi stessi vacilla tremolante, si demolisce e ricostruisce ogni giorno e finiamo per guardare noi stessi introspettivamente, senza riconoscerci, come guardassimo un altro, una forma di amnesia non patologica ma che è drammaticamente e dannatamente esistenziale.
137`4`Modiano's novel of an amnesiac trying to recover clues of his past life is engaging -- his various encounters along the way are vivid enough that the book avoids falling into the trap of having an unreliable narrator and such a foggy set of proceedings that the reader is left baffled. Instead, the clues take us someplace, indeterminate perhaps, but with a growing sense of truth. The ending, however, is extraordinarily abrupt -- we have learned all we need to, perhaps all that we can, but it still feels as though we are cheated of a proper conclusion.
138`4`Modiano's theme is as always identity. Whether it is about the sequence of events that we call time, whether we think a certain name is ours, every colourful memory will lead to another with all the games that memory plays. The search is for a recognition in the eyes of another. Maybe the search is indeed life. What is evident is that the past is perhaps not any more important than the equally adventurous search for the links. What I found amusing is that this guy (Guy!) living the humdrum life of a detective, when he decides to find himself, there are these cupboard-full of characters that roll out, each interested in giving him a box of random items and photos and magazines and what not to help him along. Exotic lives, exotic names, danger lurking in each revelation. Dreamlike unconnectedness taken in one's stride.
139`5`Modiano’s prose is lovely and austere. Not a word is wasted as he explores a man who might have been several different men searching for his identity among sets of memories.
140`4`Musí všechno, čím byl lidský život, neodvratně podlehnout zapomnění?
141`3`Mình đã cố đọc chậm lại, nhưng có vẻ Phố những cửa hiệu u tối không quá hay như những gì mình kỳ vọng. Quyển sách nằm hàng top bán chạy năm nay của tiki, cùng với anh em của nó là Ở quán cà phê của tuổi trẻ lạc lối, dù sao cũng là một điều đáng mừng cho văn hóa đọc Việt Nam. Nhìn chung câu chuyện nhạt so với mình (có thể bởi vì mình còn chưa đủ tuổi để hiểu hết những day dứt về bản thể hay khát khao nhận diện bản thân trong lịch sử mà Modiano gửi gắm trong tác phẩm, theo Dương Tường). Tuy nhiên, những phiếu thông tin về từng người (đã có thể) liên quan đến cuộc đời anh chàng đi tìm chính mình Pedro làm cho mạch kể thêm phần hấp dẫn. Cũng không thể không nhắc đến đoạn Pedro và Denise ở một mình trong căn nhà gỗ, tâm trí lúc yên an, lúc ngột ngạt kinh hoàng khi nhìn ngắm cảnh vật, và đoạn cuối truyện, là hai đoạn mình ấn tượng nhất.Một cô bé từ biển trở về nhà với mẹ, khi hoàng hôn xuống. Cô bé khóc vì chuyện không đâu, cô bé muốn chơi tiếp. Cô bé đi xa dần. Cô bé đã rẽ ở góc phố, và cuộc đời chúng ta phải chăng cũng đã tan nhanh trong chiều tối như nỗi buồn trẻ thơ đó?Có lẽ mình sẽ thử Ở quán cà phê của tuổi trẻ lạc lối sau, cũng như đọc lại quyển này trong vài năm nữa.
142`5`Mặc dù không mấy thiện cảm với Ở quán cà phê, mình lại rất thích rất thích Modiano của tác phẩm này. Mình dành trọn hai ngày cuối tuần để mê đắm, u sầu, hoang dại và ngớ ngẩn với nhân vật trong tác phẩm, theo chân "tôi" đi tìm lại chính "tôi" - một cái tôi khác, một cái tôi bị lãng quên.Dường như Modiano luôn có cái tài hướng người ta vào lớp sương mờ mờ của thời gian: tương lai, hiện tại với ông đều không có sức nặng như quá khứ. Từng câu chuyện của ông đều hướng về những nhân vị ở quá khứ - những con người của ngày xưa, những không thời gian mà họ tại vị, những câu chuyện buồn vui về họ trong con mắt người khác. Ông phủ một lớp màng mỏng uể oải, đặc chất Paris lên từng con chữ, từng chương hồi, khiến ta phải đọc chầm chậm lại, bơi trong từng con chữ đặc quánh mà ông khéo léo thả tơ, để rồi vướng vào lưới buồn của ông hồi nào không hay. Chuyến đi tìm lại chính mình của nhân vật chính trong truyện có nhiều ý nghĩa. Có thể đây là một hành trình lội ngược về quá khứ để đơn thuần thoả mãn tính tò mò, có thể cũng là một hành trình tìm ý nghĩa tồn tại của một nhân vị. Ở điểm này mình lại thấy Modiano hiện sinh một cách ngầm ẩn. Mình sẽ không spoil, vì vậy mình sẽ chỉ nhận xét nội dung đến điểm này thôi. Mạch truyện ông chậm rãi, không có nhiều nút thắt mở, cứ miên man và đừng bị chưng hửng vì cái kết... không đâu vào đâu nhé. Nhưng đọc quyển này cứ như nhấm nháp một ly cà phê sữa vào một sáng chủ nhật: nó vừa ngọt vừa đắng, nó tan nhè nhẹ dưới sức nóng của miền nhiệt đới, nó blue, như một hợp âm bảy trưởng (Maj7) đột ngột treo nhẹ giữa dòng nhạc sôi nổi. Mình sẽ còn đọc lại quyển này nhiều lần nữa. 
143`3`Một cuộc tìm kiếm chính mình, như để trả lời câu hỏi tôi là ai, là chính tôi hay chỉ là một kẻ xen vào cuộc đời mình. Những sự kiện và cuộc gặp diễn ra nhanh nhưng không vội vã, buồn nhưng không bi luỵ u uất. Thậm chí còn có chút thơ thơ dễ chịu.Nhưng mình không thích, đầu óc mình thiếu tính nghệ thuật ^^^
144`4`Na malom priestore sa rozvíja nečakane komplexný príbeh zasahujúci do minulosti, ktorý mnoho naznačuje, omnoho viac však necháva nevypovedaného - a je to tak dobre. Tématika minulosti, pamäti, miesta, ktoré v životoch iných (ne)zanecháva jednotlivec, to všetko je rozohrané na relatívne banálnom príbehu "muža bez minulosti", muža so stratou pamäte. V tomto konkrétnom príbehu však nie sú ani tak zaujímavé jednotlivé okolnosti, ako skôr celkové vyznenie a akési až všeobecné princípy života a žitia vôbec. Na tak útlu knižku zanechala prekvapujúco veľa dojmov.
145`3`Ngoài những đoạn mô tả khá là hay hay ra thì không biết ý nghĩa của cuốn ri là rì nữa :D. 
146`2`No le veo material de Nobel, de verdad que no. Me dejó indiferente. Y no sé qué cosa puede ser peor en materia de literatura...
147`5`Nobel Prize winner for Literature 2014Memories....your past:"…the sand holds our footprint only for a few seconds.” (pg 72) Review 
148`3`Nobelistin, ja varsinkin itselle uuden, kirjan lukemisen pitäisi aina olla sykähdyttävä kokemus. Sellainen mielellään ikimuistoinen kirjallinen hetki. Patrick Modiano sai nobelinsa 2014. Hämärien puotien kuja oli kaunis kirja, mutta ohikiitävällä tavalla. Muistinsa menettäneen miehen tarinaa oli silkinpehmeää lukea. Mutta siten, ettei kirja jättänyt oikein mitään jälkeä. Mistä siinä oli kysymys paitsi minuuden etsimisestä? Keitä siinä vilahteli ja miten heille kävi? Mikä oli tarinan idea tai kirjailijan syy kirjoittaa se? Lopusta palattiin alkuun yhtä muistamattomana kuin ennenkin. Miksi Modiano sai Nobelinsa? Tämän kirjan perusteella sanoisin, että kauniista kielestä ja runollisuudesta.Eikä se riitä syyksi palata Modianon kirjojen pariin uudelleen.
149`4`Não sou nada. Um homem, que sofre de amnésia, segue várias pistas para tentar saber quem foi. não se dissiparão, ao anoitecer, as nossas vidas, tão depressa como um choro, sem motivo, de uma criança? 
150`5`Nếu trên đời tồn tại tình yêu sét đánh thì trong sét đánh của mình là cuốn sách này đây (cuốn này đọc sau cuốn Ở quán cà phê của tuổi trẻ lạc lối, cả 2 đều tuyệt vời). Ngay giây phút gấp cuốn sách lại mình đã biết tác giả nào là số 1 trong lòng mình rồi. Sau này, mình nhận ra rằng, tình yêu này không chỉ vì bác Patrick Modiano, mà còn vì tuổi trẻ, vì thanh xuân và vì Paris.Mỗi đoạn miêu tả về những góc phố, về đại lộ, về hàng cây, về dòng sông, ... đều gây ra cho mình niềm luyến tiếc khôn nguôi. Paris - chỉ cần viết ra từ này đã đủ làm mình rung động. Paris! Paris! Paris!
151`3`O carte destul de interesanta despre un om care se cauta pe sine insusi, rememorand franturi dintr-un trecut incert. Finalul insa m-am dezamagit, nu am reusit sa reconstitui tot firul vietii personajului.
152`5`Once again, a quest for a past that remains undefined. Here the narrator is a privat investigator looking for a man who may or may not be him after all. Whatever the case may be, as the investigation progresses, the narrators identifies with his target more and more. The book is haunted by a crowd of characters who are all hiding something...
153`4`One of Modiano's best known works (it won the Prix Goncourt and has been translated into English as Missing Person), this novel again deals with the question of personal identity. While the last book I reviewed, Livret de Famille, considers the problem of constructing an identity out of memory, this novel considers the problem of constructing an identity without memory, through the memories of others and documents and physical evidence. The narrator, a private detective with the assumed name of Guy Roland, is actually an amnesiac. When the retirement of his boss causes the detective agency to close, he decides to work on his own case -- discovering his own past life and identity. As with many post-modernist novels, this imitates the popular genre of the detective story, while changing the rules to investigate questions of epistemology and metaphysics. Following a thread of at first insubstantial or ambiguous clues, the narrator imagines various possible identities before finally discovering a part of his identity that seems to be fairly well established, but in the end, as with the other two novels of Modiano I have reviewed, he is still not sure who he really is. One of the mysteries of his life is solved, which makes it conform enough to the genre to call a mystery, but many more remain open.If this were actually a genre mystery, I would object to many unrealistic aspects, but here these are not really the point; the point is to question what personal identity really is. An interesting book.
154`3`Opet jedna od onih knjiga kod kojih se usredotočiš na stil pripovijedanja, a sadržaj polako prolazi, mimo tebe...
155`4`Our narrator can't remember who he is. This problem is complicated by the fact that his past is bound up in the Germany occupation of France, a time the other denizens of Paris would like to forget. And so we see him move along one tenuous thread of half-remembered dialogue to another, through the fog of the past. Eventually, we will both arrive at something like an ending, but a satisfying resolution is far too much to ask from a novel that contains this brief parable of the beach man: "This man had spent forty years of his life on beaches or by the sides of swimming pools, chatting pleasantly with summer visitors and rich idlers. He is to be seen, in his bathing costume, in the corners and backgrounds of thousands of holiday snaps, among groups of happy people but no one knew his name and why he was there. And no one noticed when one day he vanished from the photographs." In a novel such as this, a coming together of memory and life and ol' chums would seem far less satisfying, would seem at odds with the work as a whole. Modiano, in short, is not the nicest of writers to his reader. The ground shifts beneath our feet just as it does for Guy, and I found myself going back to previous chapters or re-reading sections to remember what I had read and what was significant--and to little avail. The effect of this is certainly dreamlike--a word you will no doubt find some variant of in virtually every review of this text--and that is certainly not an unpleasant experience particularly if you, like I, have a tendency to read late a night in sleeping houses. That said, Modiano does assume a lot of historical and geographic information which I assume would be readily accessible to a French reader but which does exacerbate the aforementioned dreaminess of the novel when reading across cultures and which might make the novel feel like quite a lot of work for certain readers. There are pay-offs, however, passages like: "I believe that the entrance-halls of buildings still retain the echo of footsteps of those who used to cross them and who have since vanished. Something continues to vibrate after they have gone, fading waves, but which can still be picked up if one listens carefully... I was nothing, but waves passed through me, sometimes faint, sometimes stronger,and all these scattered echoes afloat in the air crystallized and there I was." God Damn, right? And that's the translation. That thing must be something else in the original.
156`4`Par certains côtés, l’écriture de Modiano m’a fait penser à celle d’Hemingway dans L’adieu aux armes : une fausse économie de moyens, une impression de simplicité qui cache une maîtrise impeccable. Guy Roland ne s’est pas toujours appelé Guy Roland. Il a eu une vie, avant, mais il n’en a aucun souvenir. Longtemps détective privé, il décide de se lancer enfin à la poursuite des bribes de ce passé oublié.Le héros se retrouve ballotté de témoignage vague en souvenir brumeux. Chaque fois qu’il croit tenir une piste sur son identité, il semble que sa mémoire fait remonter en lui des sensations et des impressions fugitives, dont il découvre peu après qu’elles étaient le fruit, non de sa mémoire, mais de son imagination. S’appelle-t-il Guy, Freddy, Pedro ? Est-il anglais, sud-américain ? Les passeports aux noms exotiques sont riches d’aventures et de secrets probables, mais où est la réalité ?Quelques photos jaunies dans des boîtes en fer blanc, des visages vieillissants, des numéros de téléphone… l’enquête qui mène le héros par le bout du nez nous révèle la vanité de l’existence : ne sommes-nous donc que la somme des souvenirs que les autres auront de nous ? Et si personne ne se souvient de vous, cela signifie-t-il que vous n’avez pas vécu, aimé, tremblé comme chacun ?Même si ce roman a une atmosphère et une intention qui nous embarquent, j’ai regretté le foisonnement de questions et l’absence de réponses. Bien sûr, la vie est ainsi. Mais les romans doivent-ils l’être ? Je crois que j’aime autant une bonne histoire avec un début et une fin, pas vous ?
157`5`Patrick Modiano protagonist looks for his lost identity in his amazing book. Patrick is one of the great writers of our time and I recommend for his readers (who haven’t seen) his Nobel Prize speech in 2014.
158`4`Patrick Modiano received the Nobel Prize in literature in 2014, with the motivation "for the art of memory with which he has evoked the most ungraspable human destinies and uncovered the life-world of the occupation." Modiano seems to be a humble person with much integrity. He was thankful to be chosen and be a part of a group of authors that he himself has always admired.Despite being a famous author in France, with 30 books, many people - readers, literature critiques and himself included - were surprised that he won the prize. Many Swedish readers were unacquainted with his authorship - which no doubt is the big publishers fault, not having translated his books lately, probably because they consider their commercial value too low. Only a smaller publisher has shown interest in his work and translated it. It's almost as if his books resembled the shadows they contain. Fortunately, Modiano's books now has the attention they deserve.Modiano was born in 1945, in Paris. His parents had met during the occupation and his early life involved some dark experiences that made the foundation of his body of work. He has an interest in uncovering mysteries from the past and in "Missing person", the main character, who has lost his memory, is searching for his identity. Clues lead back to the occupation in Paris. The core of the novel is identity and the meaning of the past. Without memories we don't know ourselves. We are only strangers, shadows without directions. The dark streets in the novel perfectly catches the main character's melancholy.Time is an essential theme. It's a floating concept, and sometimes it's difficult to decide when something occurs. The impressions of the present and past is melting together and the character's understanding of his past alters from different people's stories. Sometimes they are not even his own memories. The prose is humble but effective. Modiano is clever at portraying the deceitful memory lane, with its delusive cul-de-sacs, and how easy the subjective mind can be influenced.Authors that have received the Nobelprize are often perceived as heavy, even by people that haven't read their books, but Modiano's work is very accessible to the reader. The books are short and the prose is rather humble, though it has many levels. "Missing person" is exciting as well as accessible and should appeal to a broad group of readers.
159`5`Patrick Modiano said in his Nobel speech, "Today, I get the sense that memory is much less sure of itself, engaged as it is in a constant struggle against amnesia and oblivion. This layer, this mass of oblivion that insures everything, means we can only pick up fragments of the past, disconnected traces, fleeting and almost ungraspable human destinies. Yet, it has to be the vocation of the novelist, when faced with this large blank page of oblivion, to make a few faded words visible again, like lost icebergs adrift on the surface of the ocean." Modiano's work, Missing Person, is about the search of the main character for his past, the search of lost identity, the search of lost memory. "I believe that the entrance-halls of buildings still retain the echo of footsteps of those who used to cross them and who have since vanished. Something continues to vibrate after they have gone, fading waves, but which can still be picked up if one listens carefully. Perhaps, after all, I never was this Pedro McEvoy, I was nothing, but waves passed through me, sometimes faint, sometimes stronger, and all these scattered echoes afloat in the air crystallized and there I was." Modiano mentions in his speech that the efforts to forget, to leave the French Occupation behind, to wipe out the past clean, are futile. Yet, he could not help but still hear the echoes." "It seemed to me that the echo of our movements, of our lives, was smothered by this cotton wool which fell in light flakes around us, on the darker line of the road threading the valley." Modiano's work hints the horrors during the French Occupation, also dealing with fractured identity, memory, time, and World War II. The fact that the main character, Roland, is able to wipe his memory clean acts as a symbolic resonance of many French citizens - to forget. "We passed the Gardens and had turned down Avenue New-York. There, under the embankment trees, I had the unpleasant sensation that I was dreaming. I had lived my life and was just a ghost hovering in the tepid air of a Saturday morning. Why try to renew ties which had been broken and look for paths that had been blocked off long ago? And this plump, mustachioed little man, walking beside me, hardly seemed real." The fear is still present...it could not be totally forgotten. Wiped. Clean. "Not a light in Rue Cambon, except for a bluish reflection which must come from a shop window. My footsteps echo on the pavement. I am alone. Again fear seizes me, the fear I feel each time I walk down Rue Mirabeau, the fear that I will be noticed, stopped and that they will ask for my papers. It would be a pity, just a few yards from my destination. Above all, not to run. Walk right to the end, at a steady pace." "We crossed the street and took Rue Coustou. He quickened his pace, glancing furtively over at the sea-green bars on the left-hand side of the road, and by the time we reached the big garage, he was almost running...He did not stop until we had reached the corner of Rue Lepic.'Forgive me,' he said, out of breath, 'but this street has some odd memories for me...Forgive me...'He had been really frightened. I believe he was even trembling...We set off along Rue des Abbesses. He walked in a calm and relaxed manner...And suddenly, before we have reached Place des Abbesses, he picked up speed again...As we were crossing Rue Germain-Pilon, I saw hem cast a horrified look at that narrow street with its low, dark houses, which descends rather steeply to the boulevard below..." The answer and the context is answered in Modiano's memoir, Pedigree (2004). It is his childhood. Although he did not live in war, his parents' part affected him. His father was a French and a Jewish, but Modiano soon realised that his father never put on the Star of David badge, nor did he surrender himself when Jews in Paris were rounded up did expulsion to the concentration camps. In fact, his father managed quite well by wheeling and dealing in the blank market that was controlled by the French Gestapo. Although corrupt police and criminal figures ran the whole city, his father survived the war unharmed. Yet, his father clarified nothing for him, but was hesitant to buy Modiano's work about a Jewish collaborator during WWII. From your on, Modiano struggles to imagine and understand the Occupation period, 'the black hole of French memory'. This book is very interesting. It is detective story about finding oneself. While the character, Roland, collects mementos, pieces of Modiano's identity , his age, parents, incomplete schooling and career. Definitely very unique. He uses language beautifully, giving great detailed imageries that stretches your imagination.The original title of this book is "Rue des Boutiques"/"Street of Dark Shops". This is actually a reference to an actual street, La Via fell Boutteghe obscure, in Rome (where Modiano lived for a while). This street also appears ion Modiano's "Livret de famille", which points at small clothes shops owned by Hews. Hence, thus actually implies that Roland might have a Jewish identity.the word 'shop' also suggests Roland is 'shopping around' for his identity. He is forever empty, and will need to fill the void in him with narratives of other characters. The name of the street also embodies the word 'obscurity'. This connotes the lack of clarity, and hence shows that Roland's past is very much unknown, and he will never find a clear proof of his past that is shrouded in darkness. There is a lack of closure; the search of identity will never end....
160`4`Patrick Modiano, recent awardee of the Nobel Prize in Literature 2014, deserves his place among the greats. After one novel, I’m captivated. What I love about him is his writing style. It is quite similar to that of fellow Nobel laureates J.M. Coetzee and Ernest Hemingway. Modiano writes in a compact, reserved voice. His style does not bombard you with loads of compound sentences nor drops on you a barrel full of adjectives, unlike most accomplished writers of this generation. In fact, it might be described as simple. However, there’s a lingering presence of something I can only call ‘grace’ that envelops his writing. It is a scent that I have always known to come from delicious writing. His sparse and direct prose coupled with his penchant for descripting places translate into something classic and captivating. If Hemingway had a penchant for drink and food, Modiano is infatuated with places: streets, hotels, restaurants, roads, bridges, buildings, he creates descriptions that give one a mental map of some sort, tracing the paths of his characters and introducing new places at every turn. Also, injected into his writing is this feeling of weightlessness, as if one had the ability to disintegrate like some creature made of air. You are engulfed in your reading experience; you never realize how much time you have spent until you actually look at a clock. I loved it. “There under the embankment trees, I had the unpleasant sensation that I was dreaming. I had already lived my life and was just a ghost hovering in the tepid air of a Saturday evening. Why try to renew ties which had been broken and look for paths that had been blocked off long ago?” This novella called ‘Missing Person’ is about an amnesiac searching for his identity. This empty man named Guy Roland, who had been living in the shadows as a private detective for eight years, decided that he finally had it in him to search for his forgotten past. Along the way he rediscovers old places, meets old acquaintances, and regains pieces of his broken memory.“Hutte, for instance, used to quote the case of a fellow he called ‘the beach man.’ This man had spent forty years of his life on beaches or by the sides of swimming pools, chatting pleasantly with summer visitors and rich idlers. He is to be seen, in his bathing costume, in the corners and backgrounds of thousands of holiday snaps, among groups of happy people, but no one knew his name or why he was there. And no one noticed when one day he vanished from the photographs. I did not dare tell Hutte, but I felt that ‘the beach man’ was myself.”We all ask ourselves ‘what is the purpose of my life?’ ‘why am I here?’ We ask these questions to bring some sense of order in this business of living. We are looking for direction, a future. We are looking for a map to tell us which road to travel on, which path to take. Not a bad plan for life. But in order to be able to know what one is to do, don’t you think that one needs to know oneself? How is a traveler supposed to travel if he does not even know that he is a traveler in the first place? “You were right to tell me that in life it is not the future which counts, but the past.”Identity is built upon one thing, the past. We become who we are through the accumulation of memories and experiences. The only thing we really build in life is our identity. Yes, the future gives us some sense of trajectory, of purpose but then it is the past that controls the future. You were, therefore you are. “A little girl is returning from the beach, at dusk, with her mother. She is crying for no reason at all, because she would have liked to continue playing. She moves off into the distance. She has already turned the corner of the street, and do not our lives dissolve into the evening as quickly as this grief of childhood?” At once a mystery, but then also a journey into memory and time, ‘Missing Person’ will leave you breathless. This novel about the self tells us that oftentimes we are too busy looking for our identity in the past, asking too many questions about our purpose in the future, that the result is a life of asking and searching instead of one of living. Life need not be so complicated. Looking forward and backward is inevitable, you cannot stop doing that, but never ever fail to focus on the now. “Until now everything has seemed so chaotic, so fragmented… scraps, shreds have come to light as a result of my searches… but then that is perhaps what a life amounts to…” "Hutte was always saying that, in the end, we are all ‘beach men’ and that ‘the sand’ – I am quoting his own words – ‘keeps the traces of our footsteps only a few moments'."Whether you look at the past, the present, the future, only one thing is certain: life is ephemeral. Make it count. 
161`5`Please note that this book has been translated and is available on Amazon under the title "Missing Person" (it was translated in 1980 and published by Verba Mundi).I read this book on my Kindle in the French version (the title given here, and of course French is my mother tongue). I had bought it for my 100 year old mother who still reads one novel a week on her Kindle. She wanted to read this book as soon as she heard the author had won the Nobel. This is a book that came out in 1978, the year Patrick Modiano won the Goncourt, a prestigious French prize. Before bringing it over to her, I read it, immediately taken in by the opening lines, unable to put it down. As I am now writing this critique, I just learned from an article in the Washington Post, that "Missing Person" is the book Peter Englund, a historian and the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, recommends to readers unfamiliar with Patrick Modiano. “It’s a fun book,” Englund said. “He’s playing with the genre.” And the genre he is playing with is mysteries. A detective, suffering from amnesia, sets out to recover his identity, following a variety of strange leads.I'd like to recall here a very astute comment made sometime back by Anne Korkokeakivi, writing for THE MILLIONS, where she noted that French novels tend to be "... dark, searching, philosophical, autobiographical, self-reflective, and/or poetic (without being overwritten)."Patrick Modiano's "Missing Person" precisely fits this description. It is all these things, dark, searching, self-reflective and yes, poetic.Consider the first lines: "I am nothing. Nothing but a pale shape, silhouetted that evening against the café terrace, waiting for the rain to stop; the shower had started when Hutte left me."Amazing, isn't it? The opening sentence is just three words, but how they resound. I am nothing. That is of course the whole theme of the book. What comes next is a poetic evocation of someone barely there, uncertainly watching the rain. And the last part of the sentence immediately makes you want to know who is this Hutte - someone with a strange name if there ever was one.Yes, that is how a master storyteller starts a novel, and I guarantee that you will be turning the pages as fast as I did. And you will be wondering as the main character follows clues that turn out to be non-clues, and you will find yourself perplexed as he attempts to start conversations with people who take him for...who? Really him or someone else? This is done very subtly, especially at the level of dialogues, the kind one carries on with people one barely knows. But can one ever really know the other and oneself? So yes, the book is presented as a mystery, but the mystery is the main character...And bottom line, our own selves, each and everyone of us, how sure are you of who you really are...So how good is Patrick Modiano? Very good, five stars, I highly recommend it. And I think you'll be happily surprised what a short read it is too, featherweight, a little over 200 pages. A small perfection...
162`3`Pour les parisiens du coeur.
163`5`Probably the best Modiano I’ve read so far. Part detective story, part book about lost identities, the memories which unreliably define our past, the inane urge to assemble the fragments of our former lives in order to give meaning to the present. All that makes Modiano’s voice unique is here, the streets of Paris, the war, the fragility and the dangers of human interactions, and most of all, his delicate but precise literary style. It is a book that will stay with me and will probably alter the perception of my own past. 
164`5`Published in English under the title "Missing Person", this is a dark almost mystery like story of a man retracing a past he has forgotten. Set mostly in post WWII France, the unnamed narrator has few clues, some photos and only a blank when he reaches inside to find his past, missing for ten years. With courage, he interviews strangers and receives half answers, containing tiny clues to follow up. Reading this, I realized how compartmentalized our lives are, as different people from Guy's past helped him fill in the blanks, one tiny piece at a time. The style of writing is sparse, minimalist, but very haunting. It reminded me of Simenon's writing as they seemed to be describing the same Paris.
165`3`Pues no me encantó.Me enredó mucho el no saber si estaba recordando en verdad o solo suponiendo lo que pasó. Habla de los lugares de Paris como si pudiera imaginarlos y la verdad que no. El detalle no es suficiente. Y pues te quedas pensando en qué habrá pasado. EN fin.
166`4`REVIEW IN ENGLISHSince I discovered Modiano I am his fan. But I understand he's not an author that everyone will love. He has this pattern of writing about memories and digging into France's past. That's his jam and in this novel he digs again.Guy Roland is a man with no memories. He has been given an identity by Hutte, a private investigator that found him disoriented and with amnesia. Years later, in the sixties, Hutte is retiring and closing his detective agency and leaves Roland unemployed. Now he is ready to investigate his own past.Paris is once again the place when Modiano places the protagonist and make him go to places and walk the streets. We, as readers, understand the way the story works: we get that Guy meet people and they help him even if they don't know him. And that's how Roland start to retrieve information, adresses, telephone numbers and photograps. He is slowly trying to understand who he was.Modiano has this exquisite hability to make you go back to the past and enjoy his lirical and beautiful prose. At first the reader maybe get lost trying to learn about Roland and who he is but Guy knows even less. The story of the detective looking for a person that is himself is at start amusing but continues to develop with brillant reflections of the past, the present and memories of things long gone.The reflection of the "beach man" is too good I have to say:"Hutte, for instance, used to quote the case of a fellow he called "the beach man." This man had spent forty years of his life on beaches or by the sides of swimming pools, chatting pleasantly with summer visitors and rich idlers. He is to be seen, in his bathing costume, in the corners and backgrounds of thousands of holiday snaps, among groups of happy people, but no one knew his name and why he was there. And no one noticed when one day he vanished from the photographs."I read it in spanish (I wanted in Français but I have to study more for that) but you really can appreaciate the amazing and soft writting style. Even though the ending is a bit open and unsatisfying that doesn't really stain the book as a whole. I really recommend Modiano's books and they are always a delight to read.***********************************************RESEÑA EN ESPAÑOL Desde que me embarqué en las lecturas de Modiano siempre he sido consciente.   que no es un autor que todos podrán disfrutar de igual manera.. En este caso me encontré con una novela que tiene la ya la conocida esencia de la narrativa el autor: un viaje a los recuerdos del pasado.1965. Guy Roland es un hombre que no tiene recuerdos. El detective privado Hutte lo encontró mucho tiempo atrás, desorientado y sin recordar nada de su pasado. Por eso le ha asignado una nueva identidad ya que él no puede recordar quien es. Diez años después de trabajar con él, su amigo Hutte ha decidido cerrar su agencia de detectives, jubilarse y marcharse a Niza. Por eso Guy está desempleado y sin nada que perder, se embarca en la misión de recuperar su identidad.Modiano hace de París su lugar de destino para que sus personajes lo caminen y esto no falta en la novela. Es la historia de un detective que busca a otros pero esta vez para encontrarse a sí mismo. .  Al principio todo es bastante confuso porque el lector sabe tan poco de Guy como él mismo. .Poco a poco y tras aceptar el pacto narrativo que hacemos con el texto y que consiste en que el protagonista va conociendo personas que parecen no temerle a un extraño y le llevan a distintos lugares y le regalan objetos, telefonos, fotos, direcciones e informaciones. De esta forma lo van acercando a los trazos de las personas que lo conocieron y con las que tuvo contacto.La narrativa del autor tiene algo que siempre deja al lector con la sensación de ser transportado en el tiempo. Tiene un uso del lenguaje muy bello que hace que los recuerdos de un pasado vayan cobrando vida. La novela tiene capítulos cortos además de ciertas cartas y documentos. Los claro oscuros de la historia son evidentes, .  huecos que Guy trata de rellenar igual que el lector. y que poco a poco parece que se van aclarando. ¿Quién era en realidad? ¿Por qué algunas personas le reconocen pero él no puede recordarlas? Al parecer todo lo que va descubriendo sobre lo que le sucedió al protagonista y tiene que ver con la Ocupación nazi en Francia, solo podría decir eso para no estropear el asunto.Como ya es parte de la narrativa de Modiano los ambientes y los momentos son sumamente importantes y estos desprenden nostalgia y pérdida. Si lo leen verán que la parte del "hombre de la playa" es una bella reflexión. Tienen un alto poder de evocación y poco a poco el lector organiza las piezas para saber qué le sucedió a "Guy". Aunque el final deja las cosas algo inconclusas, creo que igualmente no desmerece el conjunto. Es una historia que plantea dudas como resoluciones. Sin duda Modiano siempre es una delicia de leer.
167`4`Read the English translation, retitled as “Missing Person”
168`4`Read the English version "Missing Person"Short, enjoyable, noirish meditation on how much the sense of self relies on memory and narrative. Last year I went under general anesthesia. I expected the weird sensation of talking to one nurse before the procedure then suddenly talking to a second nurse after the procedure with no sense of time having passed. What was really disconcerting however was that second nurse describing the conversation she and I'd had just five minutes ago. It certainly sounded like things I would say but I didn't recall saying it. For a moment I panicked as if there had been some rogue version of me, running around on autopilot (had I hit on the attractive nurse?) Then I realized that I was probably always on autopilot and I normally added the story of me after the fact. If I couldn't remember it, it wasn't part of the story..... 
169`3`Reminds me a bit of "Memento" by Christopher Nolan... the idea behind the book is outdated yet Modiano managed to give quite a new background to it in an old-fashioned and monochromatic manner.
170`4`Rue des boutiques obscures = Missing Person, Patrick ModianoMissing Person (French: Rue des Boutiques Obscures) is the sixth novel by French writer Patrick Modiano, published on 5 September 1978. In the same year it was awarded the Prix Goncourt. The English translation by Daniel Weissbort was published in 1980. Rue des Boutiques Obscures (literally 'the Street of dark shops') is the name of a street in Rome (La Via delle Botteghe Oscure) where one of the characters lived, and where Modiano himself lived for some time. Guy Roland is an amnesiac detective who lost his memory ten years before the beginning of the story, which opens in 1965. When his employer, Hutte, retires and closes the detective agency where he has worked for eight years, Roland embarks on a search for his own identity. His investigations uncover clues to a life that seems to stop during the Second World War. It seems that he is Jimmy Pedro Stern, a Greek Jew from Salonica, who was living in Paris under an assumed name, Pedro McEvoy, and working for the legation of the Dominican Republic. He and several friends (Denise Coudreuse, a French model who shares his life; Freddie Howard Luz, a British citizen originally from Mauritius; Gay Orlov, an American dancer of Russian origin; and André Wildmer, an English former jockey, all of whom are enemy nationals) went to Megève to escape a Paris that had become dangerous for them during the German occupation. Denise and Pedro attempted to flee to Switzerland, and paid a smuggler who abandoned them in the mountains, separating them and leaving them lost in the snow. ...عنوانها: خیابان بوتیکهای تاریک؛ خیابان بوتیک های خاموش؛ نویسنده: پاتریک مودیانو؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: هفتم ماه فوریه سال 2003 میلادیعنوان: خیابان بوتیکهای تاریک؛ نویسنده: پاتریک مودیانو؛ مترجم: فروغ احمدی؛ تهران، ترفند، 1380، در 219 ص، شابک: 964926840؛عنوان: خیابان بوتیک های خاموش؛ نویسنده: پاتریک مودیانو؛ مترجم: ساسان تبسمی؛ تهران، افراز، 1388، در 247 ص، شابک: 9789642430086؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان فرانسوی - سده 20 مخوانشگر از همان صفحه ی نخست، با پرسه زدنهای شخصیت داستان همراه میشود. انتظار دارد در پیچ و خم یکی از همان خیابانهایی که راوی بی وقفه از آنها میگذرد، یا توی یکی از کافه ها و رستورانهایی که، او در آنها توقف میکند، رخدادی رخ دهد؛ یا رخدادی از بگذشته بازگو شود؛ اما این انتظار تا صفحه ی پایانی کتاب برآورده نمیشود. تمام پرسه زدنهای راوی، همه ی مکانهایی که با جزئیات توصیف میشوند، تنها طعمی از بگذشته را به یاد میآورند، طعمی از گذشته، که به بوهایی از امروز نیز آغشته است. در صفحات پایانی رمانهای مودیانو، خواشگر درمییابد که انگار همه حرف و سخن نویسنده همان پرسه زدنها بوده است. مهم رفتن بوده، نه رسیدن به چیزی، یا جاییکه باید به آن رسید. مودیانو از کم شمار نویسندگان این جهانست که بلد است با داستانهایی از این دست، مخاطب خویش را تا پایان با خود بکشاند، و طعم لذتی را به او بچشاند، که کمتر جایی میتواند، آن را تجربه کند: لذت خوانش و خواندن را. در این رمان چهل و هفت فصلی، گاه خوانشگر با فصلهایی روبرو میشود، که تنها دربرگیرنده ی یک خط هستند. خطی که بازگوکننده ی یک نشانی در پاریس است. در طول داستان، مردی که به دنبال هویت فراموش شده ی خود میگردد، با افراد بسیاری دیدار میکند، و با به دست آوردن عکس، نام یک فرد، کتاب ... به بازیابی هویت خویش میپردازد. او به تدریج به نام واقعی خود پی میبرد، و کم کم خاطراتی از بگذشته در ذهنش زنده میشود. خاطراتی که خوانشگر مشتاق دانستن اش میشود. و در نقطه ی اوج داستان، با تعریف بخشی از خاطرات، خوانشگر را گیج و گنگ، و انگشت به دهان باقی میگذارد. ا. شربیانی

174`null`So sparse as to be almost devoid of voice. I warmed up to this a little towards the middle as I thought the clarity of the prose was evolving in step with the narrator's investigations, I don't think that's actually the case here though. I don't often read books that I like this little, and rarely ever do I finish them.I'm struggling to find the poetry in all of this. A little fog, some bridges, old photographs, and boxes full of trinkets, your typical noir touch points, but nothing really that soared. I liked the few mysterious segments from the perspective of a small assemblage of virtually anonymous characters who at one point in time encountered the narrator and years later happen upon some random oddity that causes them to wonder about that mysterious man from their past.
175`4`Sospeso tra presente colmo di nostalgia ed un passato nebuloso. Una storia di nomi e indirizzi che forse erano veri e forse no, forse abitati e forse no. Un giallo in senso piu ampio del termine: un'indagine sul proprio passato, sulle amicizie e l'amore. Bello come il miglior Auster, o viceversa :-)
176`5`Strange book, but I liked it. Apparently unable to remember who he is/was, a guy who has been trained as a private detective attempts to recover his lost identity. The story revolves around a terrible event that happened during the Nazi occupation of France, but is told entirely in terms of the protagonist's search for his identity, which is taking place many years later (1965). Like a murder mystery, you know just enough to keep reading, and every bit makes it more interesting to go on. Unlike a murder mystery, everything is not wrapped up neatly, which is presumably the point. Normally, this is where I would start complaining that this is too much like life, but this time I'm not going to go there, because I did not come away with that feeling. In other words, the book totally worked for me.I liked the translation, and since the author is a Nobel laureate, presumably the original is beautifully written, too. Ends a bit oddly, but then books often do, and I'm not complaining, in this particular case. An overly neat ending would not have fit with the mood of the rest of the book. I'm likely to read more by this author in future. 
177`2`Such a hollow, lethargic novel, drained of all life and energy. I don’t get the appeal at all.
178`null`Synopsis: in some ways, a missing person detective thriller, but more than that. Guy Roland has lived without a past. Now he's hunting for himself.
179`3`Só tinha lido um outro livro de Patrick Modiano: "Dora Bruder". Os dois têm em comum tratar da reconstituição da vida de alguém, muitos anos depois dos acontecimentos, que têm como pano de fundo a Paris ocupada da Segunda Guerra Mundial.A diferença é que, enquanto em "Dora Bruder" é o autor que tenta reconstituir a história duma rapariga judia, que terá acabado por desaparecer num campo de concentração, neste "Na Rua das Lojas Escuras", há um narrador amnésico que investiga o seu próprio passado e tenta descobrir quem foi.Talvez esta temática seja recorrente nas obras do escritor já que foi mencionada aquando da atribução do prémio Nobel: "for the art of memory with which he has evoked the most ungraspable human destinies and uncovered the life-world of the occupation".Gostei do livro, embora a história nunca chegue a ficar completa e as questões do narrador não cheguem a ser todas respondidas. Há um tom melancólico que perpassa do texto e alguma tristeza pelo pouco que nos é dado perceber do que aconteceu. Deixa-nos também a pensar sobre o que fica de nós, depois de passarmos..."Uma rapariguinha regressa da praia, com a mãe, ao fim da tarde. Chora sem motivo, ou porque queria continuar a brincar. Afasta-se. Já dobrou a esquina da rua — e não se dissiparão, ao anoitecer, as nossas vidas, tão depressa como aquele gesto de criança?"
180`5`Taking place both after the fact and during the occupation of Paris, Modiano's complex novel of a man searching for his past isn't a thriller, instead gathering speed slowly with his understated writing. Unlike typical occupation novels, the fact that portions of this one take place during the occupation is something that seeps into the reader's consciousness. There are no jackboots or Gestapo -- instead a menacing environment of danger and fear. It's a book that really needs to be read more than once to be appreciated.
181`4`Technika vyprávění předstírá detektivní zápletku, ale konečné rozluštění nepřináší obrat v poznání ani morální katarzi. Přesto je i tato rozsahem spíše novela pozoruhodnou variací moderní tragédie, v níž se hrdinové neúspěšně potýkají s nemilosrdným božstvem času. Ústřední motiv hledání vlastní ztracené identity je tu překryt mozaikou různě poztrácené paměti. Neznámý, který pátrá po tom, kým ve skutečnosti je, na sebe spíše nabaluje mlhu cizích vzpomínek, neboť i ostatní se postupně ztrácí a jsou zapomínáni. Všichni jsou tu postavy, které ze starých fotek už nikdo nepoznává. I když v závěru dochází k úspěšné rekonstrukci minulého života, není to nijak rozhodující pointa. Pokus o úplnou rekonstrukci vlastně selhává a přetrvává pouze silný pocit omamné trpkosti - poznání snad kruté pomíjivosti, kořeněné však jedinečnou příchutí prožitých okamžiků, které se sice také rozplývají do ztracena, zato nám propůjčují jedinečnost naší identity. To jsou jediné důležité stopy našich životů.
182`5`The Beach ManUntil recently, the American genres of noir and detective fiction have enjoyed a higher literary esteem in France than in their native United States. This situation has changed with the publication of some of the best noir and crime writing in the Library of America series. Patrick Modiano's 1978 novel, "Missing Person" shows the strong influence of American genre writing. This book was the first I have read by Modiano. The novel received little notice in the United States until Modiano won the 2014 Nobel Prize for Literature.Noir and detective genres pervade Modiano's book in style, character, and theme. The spare, clear writing approaches the "hard boiled" prose of American genres. The book is short and is probably best first read in a single extended sitting if possible. The book is artfully arranged with shifts in time and some changes in voices. The chapters range from a single sentence or two to several pages, giving the book a forward, varied flow. The book's many characters are shadowy and mysterious and each of them carries guilt and a past. The book has an urban setting characteristic of noir with scenes in bars, streets, many small shady businesses, abandoned schools and garages, old dingy apartments, train stations, and more. Much of the action takes places at night and in shadows. I found it easy to visualize "Missing Person" as a noir film.The book is set in Paris in the mid-1960s and back to the Paris of the German occupation during WW II. The primary character is a man who goes by the name of Guy Roland. As the story opens, Roland has worked for a private investigator, Hutte, for eight years when Hutte is about to retire and leave Paris. Before Hutte had hired Roland, Roland had come to Hutte seeking help in recovering his lost identity as he suffered from a near-total amnesia covering several years. Hutte gave Roland his new name and identity together with a job. When Hutte retires, Roland tells him that he is going to try to search out his past. Hutte understands and sympathizes while observing that some matters may best be left alone. Later in the book, there is a suggestion that Hutte may have rethought his belief on this matter. Amnesia and the search to recover identity are relatively common literary themes and they appear in American noir writing and film. An example is the noir writer Cornell Woolrich's (1903 -- 1968) story, "The Black Curtain" which in 1941 became an early noir film, "Street of Chance" starring Burgess Meredith and Claire Trevor.The body of the book details Roland's search to discover his memory and his earlier self. He uses his skills as a private investigator and follows through on minimal clues meeting with many people who individually offer bits and pieces about his past. Each of these individuals has mysteries his or her own. It is surprising how forthcoming and friendly they generally are with Roland, a stranger who approaches them from nowhere. The characters include diplomats, barkeeps, jockeys, gardeners, teachers, musicians, and more. Some of the characters, particularly the Dominican diplomat Porfiro Rubirosa, are historical figures. The story melds American noir/detective writing with the search for identity and with a meditation on France and Europe during the dark years of WW II and on the continuing impact of these years.While the book has a political setting with the German occupation, I thought it focused more on the evanescence of personal identity and on the compartmentalized, fragmented character of human relationships. On the latter, Roland observes about midway through his search that "[p]eople certainly lead compartmentalized lives and their friends do not know each other. It's unfortunate." The quest for personal identity is a theme throughout the book. My sense is that Roland would have been better served by moving forward with his life, pursuing his private investigator career, and finding a woman to love. I am skeptical about quests for fixed identities, particularly past identities, but it is not clear whether Roland or the author would fully agree. A telling passage early in the book involves a parable of a "beach man" who lives an existence for a moment that is quickly forgotten. Modiano's novel can be seen as a development of the following little parable. Roland reflects:"Hutte, for instance, used to quote the case of a fellow he called 'the beach man'. This man had spent forty years of his life on beaches or by the sides of swimming pools, chatting pleasantly with summer visitors and rich idlers. He is to be seen, in his bathing costume, in the corners and backgrounds of thousands of holiday snaps, among groups of happy people, but no one knew his name and why he was there. And no one noticed when one day he vanished from the photographs. I did not dare tell Hutte, but I felt that 'the beach man' was myself. Though it would not have surprised him if I had confessed it, Hutte was always saying that, in the end, we were all 'beach men' and that 'the sand' -- I am quoting his words -- 'keeps the traces of our footsteps only a few moments."I enjoyed reading this fine novel both for its own sake and its themes and for the associations if had for me with American noir writing.Robin Friedman
183`4`The Independent says (on the back cover) that it's a strange and elegant novel. At first I wasn't taken, and thought it was probably too philosophical or somehow too elegant for me. But once I got started, I submitted to the foggy atmosphere of the cyptic story and felt no desire for the sun to come out.
184`4`The Modiano Method - using photographs, documents, oral history, and reminiscences of fading individuals to reach back into a place where past is preserved, but you cannot grasp and feel it because it is a walk, a very patient walk indeed, towards a mirage. The search becomes literal here through the amnesiac detective tracing his former self. The beginning chapters are a joy to read, as one detail after other is revealed but it doesn't take long for the novel to slip into a Dora-Bruder-eshque trail to meet a person who no longer exists. A very brave, beautiful device because most of the journeys of self-discovery are aimed inwards. Here the journey is outward, through the assistance of others. It is not for this reader to tell how much is learned in the end, but a quiet passage sums up the whole ordeal:"A little girl is returning from the beach, at dusk, with her mother. She is crying for no reason at all, because she would have liked to continue playing. She moves off into the distance. She has already turned the corner of the street, and do not our lives dissolve into the evening as quickly as this grief of childhood?"
185`4`The backdrop of this novel is perfect for the themes it explores. A detective who has spent a decade learning all of the dark secrets of others, with vast investigative resources at hand, trying to find out who he is.The first thing to note is that the author does not give a single piece of personality to the main character. Normally this would be a huge flaw but for this book it works perfectly, making the character a true blank slate. You can't guess anything about his past from his current state. You have no idea what he likes, what is interests are, if he has friends. You just know that he was working as a detective and has no idea who he was before some vague accident. The novel sends the protagonist on a journey to find clues about his past self. He will meet people and spark their memories, conjuring up images of lost people they had long forgotten. He imagines himself as each person he learns about and begins to believe that maybe this is who he was in that past life. He even fills in the blanks with his own "memories" but you're never sure if this is truly who he was or if it is just his imagination. At the end you'll probably be left with as many questions as answers. Could that be the point of the book though?
186`4`The book tells the story of Guy Roland, a man with many aliases and no memory of his past. The timeline of the narrative bounces back and forth between 1965, when Guy Roland, working as a private detective is investigating his own past for clues to his lost identity, and World War II in German-occupied France and the mysterious events that led to Guy's amnestic condition. As his search continues we realize it is not just Guy's memories that have been lost, rather the world he once inhabited no longer exists. It is, among other things, a portrait of transience, the lives we live disappearing into the mist like the tears of a child, "nos vies, ne sont-elles pas aussi rapides a se dissiper dans le soir que ce chagrin d'enfant?"
187`4`The main character, let’s call him Guy Roland, is seeking his own past or if you wish his identity, after having had amnesia, as if walking through a labyrinth. Fragments of his past get somewhat cleared, but not to the extend of a full reconstruction.This being the fifth novel I’ve read by Modiano, I am getting familiar with his way of setting an atmosphere, as if letting a cloud pass a mountain top, whilst another cloud would fades out the contours of this top again, leaving us, only able to speculate about details. This is, I think, the essence of this author’s procedure. And when readers might think Modiano writes the same novel over and over, I hope they see the many wonderful nuances and variations in plot, in tone, in the colour of the atmosphere.In this particular novel, there is a tension, which story-wise comes from the historical context (France during World War II, collaboration) and becomes concrete in the form of fear. The fear which makes several people feel nervous by remembering situations, after being approached by Guy, and yet, very willing to withstand those fears.It appears that many parts of one’s memory get lost. Modiano’s novel made at least that very clear to me. JM
188`5`The novel is vividly graphic. The feeling of depression and helplessness lingered for a couple of days...
189`3`The occupation that took place in France during the war years, was (or is) something that people never got over, and for good reason. 20th century French literature has many novels and books about this dark time in France. One can add "Missing Person" by Patrick Modiano in this mix as well. The narrative is the story of a detective who is locating .... himself. Which, also, is quite the theme for contemporary fiction. From Kafka to Mishima, it is usually a journey to track down the "self" and where that may lead. Here, our hero (of sorts) has a photograph or two, where he interviews numerous people who may have known him or what ever happened to him. This novel is a bit like an espionage novel mixed in with Alain Robbe-Grillet's fiction. It's toxic combination, but still, I found the novel a bit understated for my taste. On the other hand, I really enjoyed his memoir. Still, I will go onward and check out his other novels. 
190`3`The opening line is: “I am nothing. Nothing but a pale shape, silhouetted that evening against the cafe terrace, waiting for the rain to stop; the shower had started when Hutte left me.”The first chapter introduces us to the two main characters. Guy is a man who has forgotten his past, and his partner, a retiring private investigator, Hutte, who gave Guy his new name. Hutte seems to be like a vault of history where Guy would repeatedly consult when he needs more information on his investigation into his past. The information provided by Hutte, “these directories and year-books constituted the most valuable and moving library you could imagine, as their pages listed people, things, vanished worlds, to which they alone bore witness,” gives Guy access to clues of what could have been but not the entire picture that could really reveal who he was.Going back to the opening line, it leads me to ask whether Hutte represents something that dictates Guy’s identity. With Hutte leaving Guy behind to see to his retirement, Guy is somewhat confronted with the nothingness whether of his existence or of the other’s absence, which sets into motion Guy's decision to pursue his past in order to make sense of things, to find meaning perhaps? Perhaps I am overreading this part as one line as the one above reveals too little about the intentions of the characters, but I am curious about the potential of this symbolism.Guy receives a word of caution from Hutte on just moving forward and staying in the present, but Guy, nonetheless, follows through his journey.Somehow I cannot help but associate Guy with aman in search of the self. He is a private investigator for ten years but now he goes inward to explore his identity. Hutte seems to be a guiding voice, a father figure, or society perhaps which provides him the tools to aid in his search. Guy wants to know himself and he is left to himself. This is somewhat the same with what happens to a person who is to detached from society or to a child taken away from the father who makes decisions for him. This also reminds me of a scene in chapter 43 of a boy hugging the ball: "He crosses the road, still hugging the ball. The others do not dare follow him and stand there, watching him along the pavement." This scene unfolds while the speaker is recalling Denise and Pedro. Could there be a parallelism between this boy an Pedro/Guy?All throughout the book, we, together with Guy, are given a recurring but gentle caution on whether it is really worth looking back to the past.Chapter 1: “But look here, Guy, I wonder if it’s really worth it.”“My dear ‘Guy Roland,’ from here on don’t look back, think only of the present and the future...”Chapter 2“You’re right, one must live in the present...”Chapter 4I watched him entering the lighted entrance hall. He stopped and waved to me. I stood motionless, the large red box under my arms, like a child returning from a birthday party, and I felt certain at that moment that he was saying something else to me but the fog was muffling the sound of his voice.Chapter 5Nice is a city of ghosts and spectres, but I hope not to become one of them right awayChapter 8Hutte was always saying that, in the end, we were all "beach men" and that "the sand" - I am quoting his own words - "keeps the traces of our footsteps only a few moments."And so on...Whether the caution is in the form of words spoken directly by the characters or a heavy feeling of dismay and regret for the time long gone, the atmosphere is palpable every step of the way. In addition, Guy is handed with tokens from the past from every person he interviews whether it may be an old news clipping, a red box of old photos, and etc. The tokens he is handed are the only living proofs that those people, shops, alleys, and etc. ever existed. The wind of time has erased a lot of things just as it has erased little by little the grains of memory from the witnesses who have lived to see them. Now, as Guy revisits these lost places none of them remain except the old photographs and tokens.Could this be an exploration of man's desperation to make memories last? of how we need to document everything just in case our memories fail us and time has blown away the last vestiges of our past?Guy, together with people he “recalls” the past with, may have tried to piece together the different facets of his identity, and for those they couldn’t recall they confabulated these memories. This is when I understood that perhaps the intention of Modiano is to show how confabulation shapes our supposed memories of the past. This tendency to confabulate illustrates how unreliable memories are, how pointless to continuously look back on things that can easily be eroded with false images we allow ourselves to imagine whenever it is convenient. Confabulation confuses the real memory with false memory, and we are left with an ending that neither satisfies the search nor concludes what really happened to Guy and Denise when they tried to cross the border.I noticed the shift in perspective right around chapter 43. I do not know whose perspective this is but it gives me the impression that it is of a woman. Who is this woman? The succeeding chapters are somewhat fragmentary and can be confusing at times. These chapters are somewhat like small flashes that mimic the behavior of our memories.The story ends with the following sentence:“She has already turned the corner of the street, and do not our lives dissolve into the evening as quickly as this grief of childhood.”
191`2`The story improved as I read, but it all hangs on such an improbable series of developments at the beginning that I couldn't suspend my disbelief and go along.I did appreciate the haunting mood created by loss of memory and identity during the Nazi occupation of France.
192`3`The writing is special: unique in style, often lyrical and philosophical in tone. Both abstruse and atmospheric. What makes the style unique is the mix of concrete facts (addresses, dates, telephone numbers) and diffuse, atmospheric and philosophical musings. The writing pulls you in with its lyricism and baffles, confuses and keeps you searching for understanding. It is in fact the writing that is the best attribute of the book.This is the story of an amnesiac searching for his past. The past is Paris during the Occupation. The now, when he is searching, is in 1965. He is in a fog, and so is the reader. Slowly the fog dissipates. The central theme is identity, understanding of self and who we are, how we see ourselves and how others see us. So why not more stars? I think the author makes too much of a mystery of our inability to understand ourselves. This is nothing that surprises me. Also, I found the book to be overly confusing.The audiobook is narrated by Bronson Pinchot; the translation by Daniel Weissbort. The lyricism of the lines shines through; this must be accredited to the translator. Pinchot's French and the inflection used for the central character (Guy Roland) are superb. The listener hears the queries troubling Roland. They feel genuine.
193`3`The writing style is simple, but it is confusing for me for the use of address, name, and facts. Might reread it again. The ending threw me off for it left me hanging. Looks like Modiano made the ending intentionally that way.
194`5`There is a genre in film and literature of the person suffering from amnesia who attempts to recover his past. The narrator is one "Guy Roland," a detective who, upon the retirement of his boss, one C. M. Hutte, decides to recover his past. The road takes him to Nazi-occupied France and an attempt to flee from a Vichy French ski resort to Switzerland. But on the way, he discovers a strange jigsaw-puzzle of strange characters which he has to try to put together in some reasonable way. At one point, the narrator muses:Strange people. The kind that leave the merest blur behind them, soon vanished. Hutte and I often used to talk about these traceless beings. They spring up out of nothing one fine day and return there, having sparkled a little. Beauty queens. Gigolos. Butterflies. Most of them, even when alive, had no more substance than steam which will never condense. Hutte, for instance, used to quote the case of a fellow he called "the beach man." This man had spent forty years of his life on beaches or by the sides of swimming pools, chatting pleasantly with summer visitors and rich idlers. He is to be seen, in his bathing costume, in the corners and backgrounds of thousands of holiday snaps, among groups of happy people, but no one knew his name and why he was there. And no one noticed when one day he vanished from the photographs. I did not dare tell Hutte, but I felt that "the beach man" was myself. Though it would not have surprised him if I had confessed it. Hutte was always saying that, in the end, we were all "beach men" and that "the sand" -- I am quoting his own words -- "keeps the traces of our footsteps only a few moments."There is an old quote to the effect that "the past is a foreign country." Not only that, but Modiano shows that one's own past is also a foreign country full of insubstantial characters, places, and events. Even the names of his characters is a strange mixed bag that looks as if they blew in on some sirocco from North Africs or elsewhere: Freddie Howard de Luz, Pedro McEvoy, Paul Sonachidze, Bob Besson, Gay Orlov, Oleg de Wrédé, André Wildmer, Denise Coudreuse, Jean-Michel Mansoure, Alec Scouffi. There is even one real historical character thrown in for good measure -- Porfirio Rubirosa, a real-life Dominican diplomat and international playboy.Unlike detective novels which attempt at a crystalline resolution that snaps into place like one of Sherlock Holmes's wilder solutions, Missing Person has all the passion of a search into one's own past without any of the false certainties. The above quote really puts the whole book into perspective. If you as a reader demand that the whole package be neatly died together and wrapped in a red bow, you will be disappointed. I have read Modiano before; his Out of the Dark alerted me to the type of writer he was -- an architect of lightly phantasmagorical structures. I am happy to say he did not disappoint me.
195`5`This book is filled with the sort of lost souls that forgot their coin for Charon. Missing Person is a dark, terse underworld monomyth. From which would you drink Mnemosyne or Lethe?
196`1`This book, to me, was the most uninteresting piece of literature I have ever laid my eyes on - and that includes unpublished manuscripts as well. I read it solely because I had never thought of Modiano as more than "train station literature" before he won the Nobel prize. The story is uninteresting - the "depths of personal identity" and so on touch me in no way whatsoever. chronic constipation is a touching subject as well - if a book is bad, it's bad, however "deep" the intended subject may be. This book has no style - literally, the prose has no style. it is bland and without personality. If I hadn't read it in french, I would have thought it were one of those bad translations where they try to make the text very "ordinary" in order not to confuse the reader too much about "unordinary" use of language.The story is ludicrous. Events follow each other in no credible way, in no interesting way. it's a hunch leading to one chance meeting, which launches a hunch which leads to another chance meeting. It's not someone one can buy, it's not something that's interesting to read, it's not anything, it's like a school exercise. Finally the whole story is built on some kind of police novel suspense. I'm not particularly sensitive to suspense, but I can at least judge when one is good or not. There are so many good police novel writers who also write on important topics - why does this one get so much attention? This is not only built like a police novel, but it's a bad police novel, with no other intrigue than "who is the main character" - I don't give a damn who he is ; tell me why he is supposed to be interesting? can anyone?I stoped reading this book at about 3/5th. It was the first time I have given up on a book in 7 years. I remember the last time because I am stubborn, and hate giving up, but this book broke me. Everything was pointless, nothing was interesting. Why did Modiano get the nobel Prize? maybe his other books are worth something, but after this thing, I won't be the one to check them out. Why did this book get the goncourt prize? he was certainly just lucky - the prize is decided in advance between France's largest book publishers, to be attributed to one of their pet authors. Maybe the book has no soul or lacks basic plot because he was told "write something and you will win a prize", and so he did, and made money off of it. why him? hell if I know, hell if I care - for all I'm concerned with, this book can be forgotten and spat on as a pathetic waste of time.
197`null`This guy just won the Nobel prize. Who gives a shit, right? But then there's this: "He studied at Lycee Henri-IV in Paris, where his geometry teacher was Raymond Queneau, a writer who was to prove a major influence." -- You just said the magic word -- QUENEAU! So my interest has piqued...
198`5`This is fabulous. Noirish..., literary..., with real depths....
199`4`This is probably a book I would have given five stars to, but my reading of the first half was hindered by an overly-critical eye. I was eager to find a deeper meaning to the leitmotifs Modiano presents, that I approached the book more like a puzzle than I should have. I more or less tried to glean a second reading out of my first reading, to the detriment of my understanding.When I finally was able to slip into the prose and to accept the book at face value while I read it, my enjoyment was much greater. I'll read this again in a few months and probably revise my review.
200`4`This is the second of two novels by Modiano that I read back-to-back within a day. Though published twelve years apart, this novel and Honeymoon (1990) share a lot of similarities. In fact, Modiano has himself stated that he more or less writes the same book over and over again as he is obsessed with questions of memory and identity as they relate to the Paris Occupation. In both of these novels, the central male character lives in mid-1960s Paris and is trying to reconstruct missing pieces of the past, his own or that of others, from 1940s Paris during the war. Missing Person is a detective story, but instead of trying to answer the question "who did it?," Modiano is searching for an answer to"who was/am I?" Memories are of course tied to locations, and as such his descriptions of cafes, restaurants and boulevards can be a bit off-putting, but by and large this is a fast-paced existential mystery noir.
201`5`This novel is probably one of the seminal works of French literature from the seventies - and one of the highlights of Modiano's impressive career. It's a beautiful, haunting, profoundly melancholic novel where the reader will find the essence of what is Modiano's world (some critics have blamed him for revisiting the same themes over and over again through his books). The story is quite simple: in the mid-sixties, a man who has suffered from amnesia tries to find out about his past, and goes on a quest that will lead him to meet different people who may, or may not, know about who he was. The writing is exquisite yet never showy: Modiano is one of those writers whose style is absolutely unique but difficult to describe; it hits the perfect note in a low-key mode, without literary flourishes. Each word, each sentence is exactly the right one. But what makes this novel so deeply intense and moving is the half untold story that slowly unfolds without really finishing at the end, the atmosphere that emanates from it. The hero tries to reconstruct what his past may have been, and it's a sad past, but he'll never be sure of what happened, and he'll never know all about it - and the reader won't either. It's not frustrating: it captures something of the evanescence of life and memories that is heartbreaking. The empty streets of Paris at sunset or at night, figures from the the past with exotic names and shadowy lives, older people who survive alone with their memories... Modiano's world is dark, and flirts with the film noir ambiance, but it never really becomes a thriller: it's more a nostalgic, slow-paced meditation on the passing of life, where the mysteries are never solved. One of the most fascinating aspect of the novel is that all that is linked to the past takes place in the thirties and forties, when France went through some tumultuous events, but Modiano never describes those events, although they do play a key role in what happens to the hero: anyone who doesn't know much about France history will miss a lot of what makes this novel so poignant and beautiful. 
202`5`This one grew on me over time. At first it seemed a little bit like reading a policier that has been hollowed out, a mystery novel where there was no crime. The point seemed to be all of the figures drifting in and out of the narrator's search, with their little stories, and their detailed and specific Paris locations.But then, of course, a mystery is revealed, though also not revealed, or not in detail, but it still doesn't feel like a mystery novel.Overall I think that the pervasive feeling is one of sadness and smallness: to have lived so long, interacted with so many people, and made so little impression is tremendously sad. As for the mystery itself, I found myself thinking that many people must have suffered fates like this one, also nearly anonymous, unremembered, small local tragedies. 
203`4`This small book is set in the mid 1950's. Guy is searching for his identity. For seven or eight years he has been working in Paris as a detective for a man named Hutte, but Hutte is retiring and moving to Nice. Guy turns his attention to looking for his own identity. He seems to have amnesia as a result of something that happened during WWII. His real name is not Guy - that the name on the papers Hutte got him after Hutte was unable to find out his identity.For an unexplained reason, Guy first contacts a bartender, who introduces him to a friend who manages a restaurant and those two tell him of a Russian he should talk to, which he does. The Russian provides him pictures and names/addresses that lead him to a piano player, who gives him pictures/addresses that lead him to someone else and so on and so on. Guy starts with no idea who he is, then thinks he is someone he isn't, and finally learns he was called "Pedro," but that the Pedro identity was probably not is real identity. As the search goes on, Guy has glimpses of the past. He sees himself with his girlfriend and others and he sees events that happened. But all is shrouded in a mist that never fully lifts. There are spots of great prose among the detecting dialogues Guy has with those people he tracks down and questions, some of whom are quite weird. For example, But why does my clouded mind retain the image of Scouffi, this fat man with his bulldog face, rather than anyone else! Perhaps because of the white suit. A bright spot, like a burst of orchestral music or the pure sound of a voice amid the crackling and interferences when you turn the knob of a radio ... .The book is short and easy to read but there is a lot going on under the surface. To understand it, you need to know that Guy's amnesia is related to WWII and that the Paris he lived in at that time was occupied by the Nazis - a very scary time to be living in Paris. This is never mentioned directly in the book and requires the reader to have an understanding of what was going on during that time. 
204`4`This street really exists in Rome. Itis there that the Aldo Moro's body was abandoned because it is located between the seat of the Communist party and the Christian Democrat party.It is the first Modiano's book I read.There are recurrent themes: ; lost identity, the self search,descriptions of Paris. the style is splendid. There is really that we can call "a Modiano little music"A giant
205`3`This translates to "Missing Person". Another translated to English book! I like books with an end, whether you like it or not. I was left hanging.
206`4`Tremendously atmospheric book - this is the first I have read by Patrick Modiano, and will certainly be searching out more, especially the Occupation Trilogy. Not too difficult to read in French, though I had to go back a bit from time to time, to make sure I hadn't missed anything. It is such an interesting idea, and one that does of course happen from time to time, and quite possible by the end to see why the protagonist became amnesiac. Well worth reading.
207`5`Tôi là ai? Nhân vật của Modiano dường như luôn lạc lối trong quá khứ và hiện tại. Những mảnh ký ức, những con người của dĩ vãng có giúp họ tìm lại chính mình hay chỉ đánh thức những cảm xúc đã qua?Một buổi chiều đọc sách trong quán cafe.
208`4`Um detetive particular com amnésia resolve conhecer seu passado depois da aposentadoria. Mais um romance de Modiano em que o presente da memória é o personagem principal.
209`5`Uma história que o protagonista que sofre de amnésia sai em uma jornada para descobrir sobre seu passado já chama atenção do leitor. Mas quando este consegue trazer questionamentos sobre o auto conhecimento através de memórias inspiradas por fotos que conseguiu através de suas investigações, isso lhe leva a outro patamar. Com elementos de quase romance policial, essa obra envolve o leitor e agrega alguns pensamentos maravilhosos.
210`5`Uma odisseia como uma procura de si mesmo, uma história magnífica, contada de uma forma simples, tocante. Excelente!
211`5`Un homme amnésique enquête sur lui-même. Dans le style brumeux de Modiano, de fausses pistes en impasses... qui est Guy Roland ? 5 étoiles pour ce chef d'oeuvre.
212`4`Un texte superbe, un retour à la vie grâce au retour des souvenirs, un bonheur de lecture
213`3`Un uomo ha perso la memoria e la sua identità, e va alla ricerca del suo passato. Voci e ombre ricompaiono come echi del tempo, rumori di fondo, onde ormai smorzate. Riaffiorano immagini, come fugaci frammenti di sogno che uno cerca di afferrare al risveglio. Nella stessa maniera il protagonista prova a inseguire gli scoordinati ricordi che ricompaiono come attutiti dalla nebbia o soffocati dalla neve, per ricomporre la propria vita trascorsa. Perché, forse, questa è la vita: brevi attimi sospesi, dei fermi immagine, su cui costruire un prima e un dopo....tutto mi è parso molto caotico, spezzettato... Brandelli, briciole di qualcosa mi affioravano d'improvviso alla memoria. E proprio come un sogno particolarmente "caotico e spezzettato" ho trovato questo romanzo della prima produzione. Mi chiedo se mi sarei appassionata così tanto a Modiano se lo avessi incontrato per la prima volta in questo modo; se l'avrei cercato a respiro pieno e con grande soddisfazione come mi è capitato in questi ultimi anni. Mi chiedo se invece non sia cambiata io nei suoi confronti. Verificherò con la prossima lettura: Dora Bruder mi sta aspettando.
214`5`Unohdus, traumat, sota-ajan muistot... Hienosti rakennettu tarina miehestä etsimässä itseään Pariisin kaduilla, rakentamassa identiteettiään muistin kerroksista, pienistä vihjeistä, keskustelujen pätkistä hämyisissä kahviloissa. Kuka muistaa meidät, jos emme itse muista itseämme? Kuka tunnistaa sinut, jos katoat itseltäsi?"Minä uskon, että talojen eteisissä kuuluu vielä niiden ihmisten askelten kaiku jotka sittemmin ovat kadonneet. Jokin jää väräjämään heidän jälkeensä, yhä heikompina aaltoina mutta jotka voi kuulla kun on tarkkaavainen."
215`2`Vecāku grāmatplauktā jau kopš manas bērnības dusēja Patrika Modiano “Tumšo bodīšu iela”, pacietīgi gaidot, kad to kāds beidzot izlasīs. Un 1978.gada grāmatu klāstā tai tiešām būtu bijis jābūt spīdeklim – kā nekā tā saņēmusi Gonkūra prēmiju, savukārt Modiano 2014.gadā saņēmis Nobela prēmiju literatūrā. Daudzsološi, vai ne?Grāmata ir salīdzinoši plāna un stāsta par kādu atmiņu zaudējušu cilvēku Gī Rolānu, kurš nu nolēmis sadzīt pēdas savai pagātnei. Alkst atrast sevi, un vienlaikus baidās no tā, ko atradīs. Stāsts paliek nepabeigts... Gī vēl jāveic pēdējais mēģinājums – jāaizbrauc uz Romu, savu bijušo adresi, Tumšo bodīšu ielu 2. Aizverot grāmatu, grūti bija definēt - par ko īsti bija stāsts, pēc pāris dienām grūti pat bija restaurēt saturu.Šķiet, es (vismaz pagaidām) nepiederu pie “Gī cilvēkiem”.
216`4`Very fast read. Touches in a particular way the Invasion of France in a very personal way, never really talking about War but as a 'fear' for their 'kind'
217`4`Very well written, pared down and quietly disturbing…my favorite kind of novel.The author, Patrick Modiano was the winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in literature. This novel won the prestigious Prix Goncourt in 1978. It’s the story about a detective who loses his memory; and, for his final case he sets out to uncover his true identity. Amnesia is often the result of some tragic occurrence in a person's past. So, I felt a sense of heightening tension when he gradually uncovers fragments of his mysterious past history. As he follows leads going back to the 1940's Nazi Occupation of Paris (which may or may not be clues to his past) the novel becomes less a thriller and more a probing self-reflection on identity, memory and the passing of life. This story reminded me of a quote from another book that I read some time ago:” There is something miraculous in the way the years wash away your evidence, first you, then your friends and family, then the descendants who remember your face, until you aren’t even a memory, you’re only carbon, no greater than your atoms, and time will divide them as well.”I was absolutely captivated by this lyrical and sometimes surreal gem of a story. 
218`4`Vous aviez raison de me dire que dans la vie, ce n'est pas l'avenir qui compte, c'est la passé." Rues des boutiques obscures, 175. The past in Modiano's novels is almost always a focus of search and discovery, and it is usually found, if found at all, somewhere in the streets of Paris, which he maps meticulously. The past must be sought out because usually his central characterz don't know quite what happened and are haunted by names, scenes, and situations they can't quite identify. This particular novel, which won Modiano the 1978 Goncourt Prize, is an extreme example. The narrator, a newly retired detective, is an amnesiac whose memory of the past is blocked by trauma, a trauma that itself is not remembered. So what we have here is a sort of detective novel in which the search is not so much for "who committed the crime" as "who am I" and "what did I do?" The search leads back to a time that obviously haunts Modiano himself, the Occupation, and into the murky world of "sans-papiers," some with Jewish connections, who are living in constant fear. While there is something a bit implausible about this amnesiac narrator, Modiano's novel says something important about memory and the past, a terrain that all of us can explore and re-explore without ever quite understanding what really happened and, in a sense, who we really are (if we "really are"). This novel is a quick and enjoyable read. The French is not difficult, and the mystery keeps pushing one forward.
219`4`Weird eerie kind of detached story that I felt was going nowhere and then it kind of did but also still didn't but captivated nonetheless. Very short!
220`5`What gives us our identity? Is it our name, nationality or religion? Does memory have anything to do with it? Modiano explores all this in Missing Person.Ostensibly the missing person is Guy Roland—a 53 year old private detective in 1965 Paris. We find out later that there are a number of missing persons, but Guy is the most interesting because he has amnesia and is trying to find who he really is. Modiano has Roland searching throughout Paris, and several other exotic places. He encounters Russians, Greeks, Brits, Americans, and Dominicans. He writes memos to himself because he cannot trust his memory. He has flashbacks and encounters people who may be able to provide a clues by means of Adriadne's Thread—a logic process that is used to solve difficult problems such as we would find in a maze, a sudoku puzzle, or chess. People generally want to help him, and most often give him pictures, articles or objects that they hope will jar his memory, though he never outright tells anyone that he has amnesia. The story is told as a first person narrative through the mind of Guy Roland, who we discover is not a reliable source, as he does not know who he is. We find out right away that his name is simply a placeholder until he can regain his true identity. The first sentence in the book is "I am nothing". His search takes him through the archives of Paris as he searches birth records, relives events from the 30s and 40s and tries to find out when he lost his identity and what triggered it. He discovers that he is Jewish, and does not feel safe in WWII Paris, and this figures prominently in his search, as it also does in Dora Bruder. Modiano explores the intricacies of memory, and how it relates to smells, neighborhoods, restaurants, and even beauty marks. We also witness the changing ethnicity of Paris over a period of 30 years. Characters are losing their nationality because of the pressures of the war. There is collective guilt and repressed memory. There are aliases, murders and even a suicide. I was as lost as Guy in trying to figure out who he really was. I did not figure out even how old he was until I was 3/4 of the way through the book. This was my 3rd Modiano novel, and so far it is my favorite. It would stimulate a great discussion in a book group.
221`4`What is possible when the missing person you seek is you? Where are the clues that will lead you to yourself? Only in the past. The past, for the protagonist of  Patrick Modiano’s novel  Missing Person, is the period of the German occupation of Paris prior to and during World War II. It is a past of which, when the novel opens, he remembers nothing. Suffering from near total amnesia, he has lived for a decade as a private detective, solving other people’s mysteries, under the name given him by his boss. He is Guy Roland. As the novel opens, Roland’s boss retires and closes the agency, and Roland begins to investigate himself, to search for his identity. The novel opens with, “I am nothing. Nothing but a pale shape, silhouetted that evening against the cafe terrace, waiting for the rain to stop; the shower had started when Hutte left me.”And so begins the journey from nothing to something. The novel is saturated with the irony of the detective searching for himself, who is known by all those he meets, but who knows none of them. And as his memory begins to return in bits and pieces, brief snatches of the past, he discovers at the heart of his search for himself the dark secret, gradually revealed, of his role in the disappearance of someone very close to him.Patrick Modiano won the 2014 Nobel Prize for Literature.  Missing Person is an early novel (1978), but it embodies the themes for which Modiano has become known—the power of the past and the search for identity. The prose in this short novel (under 200 pages), while exploring these themes, exhibits Modiano's beautifully crafted style and his haunting, melancholy tone. His protagonist at one point says, “I believe that the entrance-halls of buildings still retain the echo of footsteps of those who used to cross them and who have since vanished. Something continues to vibrate after they have gone, fading waves, but which can still be picked up if one listens carefully. . . [I omit a phrase here to avoid a spoiler.] . . . I was nothing, but waves passed through me, sometimes faint, sometimes stronger, and all these scattered echoes afloat in the air crystallized and there I was.”Beautiful stuff.I loved reading this novel, like slowly eating a perfect lasagna, or ravioli, with a glass of good Cabernet, each bite chewed slowly, savored. I would have liked to give  Missing Person an unqualified 5-Star rating, but when I got down to that last bite, I found it delicious but unsatisfying. The tone of the short final chapter is exquisite, and the final two sentences are stunning. But alas the resolution of the story, which is, after all, a novel's raison d'etre, was left open-ended, and I confess I felt betrayed. I highly recommend this novel to anyone who loves finely crafted style in literature and the deep exploration of human identity. Those looking for high action will be disappointed.
222`4`When I heard that Patrick Modiano had won the Nobel Prize, I was surprised, because the only book of his that I had read was the -admittedly delightful- children's book Catherine Certitude. So clearly I had missed something - a big gap in my knowledge of French literature that needed to be remedied.It took me about 30 pages to get into this book. Written in 1978, it appears to take place in the late 1950s or early 1960s. The narrator lost his memory ten years ago and has since made a living as a private detective. Now that his boss is closing the agency, he decides to put his skills to work on figuring out who he was. And so begins an odyssea that will lead him from a circle of Russian immigrants to an island in French Polynesia, with a detour to the border town of Megeve. It starts with a photograph of an old Russian patriarch and a young girl, who turns out to have been the girlfriend of a man who was a friend of the man that the narrator might have been. Everybody he tracks down adds one or two pieces to the puzzle, but no one recognizes him. Was he Pedro McEvoy, clerk at the Domininican embassy in Paris before WWII? And was that even his real name? The narrator goes from photograph to phone number, from address to newspaper cuttings, trying to piece together who he was and what happened to him, and to the girl Denise who he seems to remember was his lover. But all clues fizzle out - people have died or have moved away. Archives were burned during the War, phone numbers have been reassigned. Towards the end, the narrator regains some memories : of him and his friends having used fake Dominican passports to travel to the border town of Megeve, and of having paid two shadowy characters to guide them over the mountains into neutral Switzerland. The tone of the book is best described as elegiac. There is a sense of loss, pervasive and sad. The narrator has lost not just his name and his identity, but as he tries to figure out who he was, it sometimes seems like his entire past has been eradicated. Even the people he thinks he knew before he lost his memory don't recognize him. The people he interviews think back with nostalgia to "les bons temps" before the war, but often refuse to give too much detail, as if paralyzed by the fear of getting stuck in the past. The small group of friends that gathered in Megeve and tried to escape from occupied France has fallen apart - one girl a suicide, another apparently vanished from the earth; one young man a recluse in French Polynesia and his friend an amnesiac. There is no grand finale, no joyous reunion with the friends of his young days, just a sad determination to travel on to the "Rue des Boutiques Obscures", the last known address of the man the narrator believes himself to be.The French is remarkably simple and sparse. Some of the encounters are almost surrealistic in their simplicity. Even very short encounters are haunted by the sense of loss, of good times having fled, leaving only dreariness and loneliness. In some ways, the style reminds me of Georges Simenon, who also had that talent of evoking a hotel room, a seedy bar, a train compartment with just a few sentences.
223`4`When the missing person is yourself and you are trying to figure who you are is the quick synopsis of Missing Person by Patrick Modiano. Lots of opportunity for reflection while reading this short but thoughtful book.
224`3`While I'm not a big fan of noir fiction, after reading "Honeymoon," I found myself drawn to Modiano's succinct writing style. "Missing Person" takes the form of a treasure hunt as Guy Roland searches for his identity. Perhaps were I more familiar with the arrondissements in Paris, the search might have been more interesting. Some food for thought, but a bit of a disappointment for a Nobel Prize winner.
225`5`Who? What? Where? Why?This was my second Modiano novel, and once again more questions crop up than answers. In Villa Triste the protagonist was a stateless person, here the protagonist, Guy Roland, has lost his memory and is in search of his identity, and by extension a search for his self.As other readers have already provided good summaries of the plot in their excellent reviews, suffice to say that Guy follows up scattered clues and finds fragments of information which he pieces together, and which at times jolt his memory. Repeatedly he is given biscuit tins and hatboxes filled with photos and other mementoes, and this is what struck me most: in the end, once we are gone we are simply a few photos, notes and other small mementoes stuck in someone's discarded biscuit tin - or perhaps these days the biscuit tin is obsolete and we continue to exist on an unused phone, tablet, or an unaccessed cloud account.Here today, gone tomorrow.
226`2`Why do I keep reading those french authors? I can hardly recall a good french novel.This novel is about Guy Roland, who several years ago lost his memory entirely, and now sets to a detective journey of recalling. Most of this journey. pardon my french, is boring.On his way, Roland gathers shreds of memory, unrelated pieces, which at the end merge to a coherent and dramatic story. The last part - merging all the parts of the jigsaw puzzle (and puzzle) together, is done beautifully, and cleverly. really. So at the end this book is not a total boredom.
227`4`With a touch of detective story ( isn't looking back and trying to unravel the threads of one's past a detective work after all ?), this short novel brings forward the old question - how much of what we remember is true and how much is fiction? How much of what we think we remember is actually a reconstruction work from unreliable bits of information put together from what we hear or learn or from what other people tell us? The book is also a meditation on memory and identity, on the struggle to find your ( true) self while looking in a shattered mirror. 
228`4`Wonderful exploration of occupied Paris through the lens of an amnesiac using the tricks of the private eye to track himself down - a very clever structuring device made all the more fun by frequent shifts in epoch without notice or explanation.
229`4`Workin' on mysteries without any clues.—Bob Seger"Je ne suis rien." (I am nothing)I am nothing. Nothing but a pale shape, silhouetted that evening against the cafe terrace, waiting for the rain to stop."Patrick Modiano was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2014. I had never heard of him before that. Most of his novels then had not been translated into English. I ignored him until this week, having read Ilse’s review of another Modiano book: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...and having some driving time to do, I listened to this book, his sixth, with the original and more appropriately poetic title, Rue des Boutiques Obscures. In Missing Person, we have a novel about memory, about reconstructing the past even as it fades away. "The sand holds the traces of our footsteps but a few moments." Guy Roland is a detective with (improbably) amnesia working on cracking the most important case of his life: Who am I? Apparently, he was Jimmy Pedro Stern, a Greek Jew from Salonica, who was living in Paris under an assumed name, Pedro McEvoy, and maybe working for the Dominican Republic. Maybe. Roland was a name given to him by his former boss, Hutte, who rescued him, gave him a job, the last assignment of which was to find Roland’s own true identity. The novel is primarily about Roland’s meeting people to ask them questions, as a detective would do, to find a scrap here, a scrap there, of his past. Is this tidbit of information a blind alley, a false lead? Is the thing that it makes me recall important to the puzzle or not?"Scraps, shreds have come to light as a result of my searches. . . But then that is perhaps what a life amounts to."Missing Person is a seventies existential mystery about the search for identity, which is always reconstructive, flawed, partial, in part a fiction. Roland (and Modiano) are engaged in a process of unlocking the past, especially thirties and forties Paris as it relates to the Occupation when Modiano's father, a Jew and a petty criminal, was believed to have worked as a Gestapo collaborator. So, as with any mystery, it's about unearthing barely discernible “shady dealings” with various Russian expatriates, and others of mixed or uncertain nationalities with whom Roland (and possibly Modiano’s father) seems to have been involved: Denise, a model; Gay Orlov, an American dancer of Russian origins, a swirl of people. Roland lost his memory from some injury in the war; was he (or was it Modiano’s father?) involved in the Communist party? The effect is a noir story that doesn’t turn thriller, but is instead a dark exploration of the past.(I first went to Paris first in 1976 with someone I loved and no longer know. Life was alive for us, new, exciting. What do I recall? Scraps of a Paris partly invented through French film, through Truffaut, through ex-pat American novels, a Paris of romantic invention: Strolling through The Jeu De Paume, the Louvre, sipping cafe au lait in cafes near Notre Dame, waking to buy wine and fresh bread and cheese to idly lounge on the banks of the Seine, the Artist’s Quarter, all that tourist jazz. What is real and invented about that time, that relationship? Why so many regrets after so many years gone by? As I read this book, I recall Ilse’s review on her evocation of Paris, I recall my own visits to Paris, of people I met there, my own scraps of the past. I’m Dorothy, falling to Oz, glimpsing images of the past, slowly passing by. Oh, there’s Anne, my high school friend, on the the Avenue des Champs-Élysées, wow, hi! Wearing backpacks, we are not allowed by the concierge to enter this bar where Hemingway once lounged. "Is it really my life I’m tracking down? Or someone else’s into which I have somehow infiltrated myself?" “The letters dance before my eyes. Who am I?”)A low Goodreads rating maybe points to the fact that nothing much happens in this short book except a man searching for clues, with the mystery never ultimately solved. A slow moving, brooding, atmospheric story told in foggy weather in a maze of apartment building corridors and cafes and dark alleyways, sifting through boxes of old photographs and letters. The effect is more poetry and dream than novel, but in a way, it may be truer to life than any neatly shaped fiction of the past most novels construct."When it comes down to it, it may be that I never was this Pedro McEvoy, I never was anything; but the waves that passed by me, sometimes distant and sometimes closer, and all those echoes that hung in the air crystallized and that was me.”Modiano’s style reminds me of Simenon, Coetzee, Hemingway, Proust, (the literary Everest of memory), Lydia Davis. The audiobook is narrated by Bronson Pinchot; the translation by Daniel Weissbort, who I have to credit with at least some of the lyricism I much liked. I’ll now go on to read more Modiano as I search for my own past as I read. 4.5, though I just may rate it higher as I read more of his books.
230`4`Written by the 2014 winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, this brief novel takes the reader along the narrator's journey to learn his own identity. What we learn is that early in the Paris occupation, the narrator and several others left Paris. The narrator presumably also attempted to escape France altogether. By raising more questions than he provides answers, as a reader, you must be content with traveling at the author's pace which is the same he allows the narrator through interviews and glimpses of recovered memory. 
231`1`YAWN...A few pretty passages, but this one was another snooze. The conclusion wasn't worth the trouble it took to get there, and that's not saying much for a book that comes in at under 200 pages. There seems an attempt here to be profound without doing the necessary work--setting, character, and conflict development. Patrick Modiano, try to write a full length novel that makes readers care about your characters. This is the second work of his that I read, and I still don't know what the Nobel prize committee was thinking. That award should have gone to Haruki Murakami, a novelist who understands the craft. 
232`4`[ compare the first document in Chapter 12, which seems meaningless both to the narrator and reader at first sight, with the document in Chapt 29. They are presented and never referred to otherwise, but taken together, they suggest a key component of Guy’s whole story.  (hide spoiler)]
233`4`[We know what happened to one of his friends, maybe 2--but the others? What really happened to him? What was his original identity? What were they involved in? If he was really left to die on the mountain, how did he get out? (hide spoiler)]
234`4`[which is complicated by the narrator’s multiple names and passports that he held during the Nazi occupation of France in his prior life (hide spoiler)]
235`3`a quietly effective parallelism between the process of self-discovery and of reading a story--between modiano's existential detective protagonist and the reader of this book--periodically emerges through the spare, distant prose. but modiano's insistence on unearthing deep truths through surface details tends on the side of fetishistic--worst of all, on the side of superficial. this isn't much fun to read and it's frankly frustrating that we felt it necessary to throw a Nobel on something so redundant, both internally (fifteen+ passages on how we and our constructed identities will eventually dissipate into the wind) and externally (writing into a saggy lineage of assertively ~Existential~ detective/mystery novels). if we're going to hand out 80% of our Nobel lit prizes to moody white male French authors, must we go with the guy who practically wears that label as a neon sign atop his head? riyl: auster, proust, sebald. 2.5.
236`1`disjointed fragments of memory which I found hard to remember. Film noir. Why so little progress in finding out who he was during 10 years of working with a detective (as a detective) whom he originally consulted? Then he starts sleuthing. Ending suggests that despite enormous progress, he will continue to search for his identity as a life long quest.
237`4`interesting to me that this won a Nobel Prize. i enjoyed it but wasn't head over heels. for a mystery (a man looking for himself), i think it unfolded to easily. but then again...good hook and concept. writing of course is well done.
238`5`lại một cuốn sách khác nói về sự hoài nghi của bản thân với những chi tiết xảy ra xung quanh cuộc đời. bản thân là cái gì? quá khứ là gì? tương lai là gì? có thể sống ổn được với thực tại không? rõ ràng, tất cả mọi người đều muốn hiểu rõ quá khứ, cho dù nó chỉ là những ký ức, nhưng, không thể không biết, quá khứ đều hiện hữu những thứ u uất, đau buồn, cũng có thể vui vẻ, nhưng một khi không có quá khứ, con người ta chẳng thể sống yên ổn với thực tại.đã hoang mang, đã bị kéo vào những trang sách ngay từ câu đầu tiên:"tôi chẳng là gì cả. chỉ là một cái bóng nhạt màu.."đó có phải là dòng suy nghĩ chính trực của tuổi trẻ, của tuổi đương muốn trưởng thành, muốn đổi mới. hay đó chính là cái giá cho sự phát triển của những suy nghĩ âu lo vô tận, những hoài nghi tự đứng trong cuộc sống mà ai cũng mắc phải trên chốn định hình bản thân. Guy Roland đã đánh mất quá khứ quá mình, chẳng ai biết lý do thật sự là gì, mà cũng chả ai quan tâm đến nó ngoài chính anh, anh muốn tìm lại nó, có thể anh muốn định nghĩa bản thân, lúc trước mình đã ở đâu, làm gì, bạn bè với ai..quá khứ như một thứ tài sản giá trị vô hình, không có nó, không thể sống trong vô tư được. anh không thể tự mình ngăn cản dòng suy nghĩ tìm về quá khứ, có lẽ, anh quan tâm đến bản thân, hoặc đơn giản với nghề nghiệp thám tử tư, anh không thể bỏ qua nó. giống như ở quán cà phê của tuổi trẻ lạc lối, phố của những cửa hiệu u tối lại xuất hiện quá nhiều quá tên. biết rằng, con đường tìm về quá khứ của một người đã đánh mất thật không đơn giản, nhưng những cái tên đã một phần làm lung lạc và ngăn cản dòng suy nghĩ của mình trên con đường đi tìm danh tính thật của Guy. Cộng thêm, lối ngắt chương và thay đổi dòng suy nghĩ liên tục của tác giả dường như muốn người đọc mất phương hướng với "những kỉ niệm kỳ cục", thứ mà các nhân vật phụ mang đến.bi kịch của guy không phải là bi kịch cá nhân, mỗi một người anh trò chuyện, mỗi một đầu mối được tìm thấy khiến anh có cảm giác như sống lại một lần nữa, để rồi được chìm trong những ký ức về howard de luz, về denise, về gay.. và cuộc sống đã từng vui vẻ của chính mình.một cái kết mở với câu hỏi về cuộc đời, chợt thấy nhớ câu nói của trịnh công sơn trong bức thư gửi cho dao ánh:"anh chỉ mong có thật ít quá khứ, người có nhiều quá khứ thường phải buồn nhiều hơn.."
239`4`missing person by Patrick MondianoMondiano weaves a mesmerizing tale of search for what one once was.The setting, post WWII France, lends layers of mystery to his search for himself. Our protagonist has memory only of the last 10 years of his life and has reached the point that he cannot continue to live in ignorance of his past. He follows faint threads, some leading nowhere, some bearing slight fruit. The success or failure of his quest is not the most important part of the story. The quest is the thing, the searching, probing, meeting and interviewing people he may or may not have known in his previous life. Does it matter who we were in the past? Is it possible to insert ourselves into another's life? Would we even want to. Are we able to manufacture a past for ourselves? While these questions are not answered, the fact that they are asked makes for a fascinating story.Highly Recommended.
240`2`not my favourite type!
241`5`one of the easiest french book in french that I have read. Love the usage of "état civil" certificates.
242`3`the narrator of this novel has amnesia for his whole life before some unspecified point. Looking for clues he tries to find out the story of his life. Eventually he discovers some very disturbing things. I found the devise of his amnesia artificial, and because I knew nothing about the narrator I found it difficult to care about his quest. It seemed that Modiano wants to open up profound questions about personal identity. I guess I hoped that the novel would do that. It didn't do that for me.
243`3`truyện đọc trên xe lúc nào cũng tạo một cảm giác tan nát hơn các truyện khác hehe, đọc truyện này để nhìn lại đời mình thấy toàn là hộp sắt có lần viết cho Q nói, chị là người theo thuyết "duy vật" =)), là người chuyên lợm lặt đồ vật, năm năm tháng tháng cần cù móc bọc gom chaivới chị có khi đồ vật còn tình cảm hơn cả con ngườigiờ nghĩ lại thì có lẽ thiếu gì cần nấy, có lẽ vì chị ít tình cảm nên mới cần nâng niu tình cảm như vậy, có lẽ thật ra cái hộp sắt sâu trong lòng chị một ngày kia mở ra chẳng có gì, ngoài "một hạt bụi bé tí":D
244`4`u buồn và trầm tư. Cuộc đi tìm cái identity của một người mất trí nhớ. Hoài niệm về hạnh phúc đã đánh mất hay đó chỉ là sự tưởng tượng, là sự tái tạo các ký ức vui vẻ để quên đi những đau buồn đầy nhức nhối. Cuốn sách đặt bối cảnh nước Pháp sau cơn ác mộng khủng khiếp thế chiến thứ Hai.Có gì đó gợi nhớ tới Paul Auster sau này trong The Oracle Night hay New York Trilogy. Những cái tên và những mặt người...

248`3`«Я – никто. Просто светлый силуэт сегодня вечером на террасе». Так начинается "Улица тёмных лавок" нобелевского лауреата Патрика Модиано. Книга-клубок, в которой Ги Ролан, потерявший память, а с ним своё прошлое и своё имя, разматывает нить в лабиринте Минотавра. Он собирает свою жизнь из осколков и фотографий, чтобы найти прошлое и обрести себя в настоящем. Модиано показывает нам послевоенный Париж, его растерянных обитателей, их семейные реликвии – как слайды в диапроекторе. Именно среди них главный герой воссоздаёт прошлое из вспышек света сквозь туман памяти. Очевидно, что в конце – драма, очевидно – что открытый финал со многими неизвестными. Как черно-белые французские фильмы. Которые я не люблю.#kyivbookworms #внеКЛАССноечтение #естьчтопочитать
249`2`«تا کی کسی نیست که مرا بشناسد!»
250`3`¿Es en serio? La decepción de la vida, ¿qué pasó con esa gente? necesitaba muchísima más información!!!! Me tuvieron intrigado durante todo el libro para eso :'( El libro no me fluyó y mucho menos porque fue obligado y para una clase que detesto, sin embargo, le di el chance de ser un libro que yo me hubiese querido leer pero no, qué decepción.
251`3`É o segundo romance de Modiano que li e continuo sem perceber a nobelização. Parece-me que ele quer ser um escritor policial (e começa muito bem nesse caminho), e às vezes um escritor filosófico (brindando-nos com algumas tiradas que ficam guardadas na memória). Mas não consegue ser realmente nem uma coisa nem outra, e por isso o romance fica ali, a marinar entre diálogos inúteis e descrições com maior ou reduzido interesse. Vale pelos bons momentos de literatura que em certas páginas se encontram e por toda a atmosfera, que o autor consegue transmitir ao leitor com pujança - mas não creio que Modiano seja um escritor muito coeso, capaz de sustentar uma narrativa longa mantendo o tino e sem ir à preguicite aguda que alguns críticos confundem com "engenho", "revolução criativa" e etcs. Um livro bom, um pouco superior a "Domingos de Agosto", mas que não dá destaque ao autor. Com tantos outros a fazerem coisas semelhantes, e bem melhor, porquê atribuir o Nobel a Modiano?
252`5`Đẹp thứ đẹp của bụi phủ, cũ kĩ và phảng phất buồn.
253`4`đúng là không có sách thì mình chả biết trốn đi đâu những lúc rối bời.
254`4`Τέταρτο βιβλίο του Πατρίκ Μοντιανό που διαβάζω, μετά τα "Η μικρή Μπιζού", "Κυριακές του Αυγούστου" και "Στο café της χαμένης νιότης", και δηλώνω για ακόμα μια φορά εξαιρετικά ικανοποιημένος. Μάλιστα, μπορώ να πω ότι τούτο βιβλίο μου φάνηκε λίγο καλύτερο από τα τρία προηγούμενα, έστω και για κάποιες μικρές λεπτομέρειες. Όπως και να΄χει, και σ'αυτό το βιβλίο ο Μοντιανό προβληματίζει και προβληματίζεται για μια σειρά θεμάτων όπως είναι η ταυτότητα, η ανθρώπινη μοναξιά, το σκοτεινό παρελθόν και η ανάσυρση αναμνήσεων. Ο πρωταγωνιστής μας θυμάται μόνο τα τελευταία δέκα χρόνια της ζωής του, όταν άρχισε να δουλεύει για ένα γραφείο ιδιωτικών ντετέκτιβ. Ούτε το πραγματικό του όνομα δεν γνωρίζει. Τώρα προσπαθεί να ανακαλύψει επιτέλους ποιος πραγματικά είναι, ψάχνοντας ανθρώπους στους δρόμους, τα μπαρ, τα καφέ και τα διάφορα σημεία του Παρισιού, που ίσως τον αναγνωρίζουν από τότε που ήταν νέος, από τότε που ήταν ένας άλλος άνθρωπος. Αλήθεια, όμως, αξίζει τον κόπο να σκαλίζει κανείς τέτοιες ιστορίες; Η γραφή του Μοντιανό είναι πραγματικά εξαιρετική, με τις περιγραφές του δημιουργεί μια φοβερή νουάρ ατμόσφαιρα, κάπως μελαγχολική και συνάμα νοσταλγική, ενώ παίρνει από το χεράκι τον αναγνώστη και τον κάνει να ταξιδεύει πίσω στον χρόνο, σε ένα Παρίσι ολότελα χαμένο στη λήθη της ιστορίας. Υποθέτω ότι το στιλ και το ύφος γραφής του Μοντιανό δεν είναι για όλα τα γούστα, όμως προσωπικά μου αρέσει πάρα πολύ, με κάνει να νιώθω νοσταλγία για εποχές που δεν έχω ζήσει και για μέρη που δεν έχω επισκεφτεί. 
255`5`Книга, която ме разочарова с края си. Обаче съвсем в стила на Модиано - философско-поетично, изпълнено с усещане за празнота, за кръженето на смисъла около пустотата, около липсата на идентичност и живота, който "се разсейва бързо като детска тъга". За липсата на спомени, която всъщност не определя нищо от ежедневието, и няма как да върне идентичността. И за параноята, чиито основания отново не стават ясни (както във Вила Тъга), дори не става ясно доколко реални са - дали са в резултат на престъпление, или са част от общата нагласа около световните войни... Тъга, тъга, тъга, толкова много тъга, така безсмислена, толкова реална, и толкова нереална, и последната надежда, която авторът дори не описва - улица "Тъмните магазинчета". А и защо да я опише, след като няма значение какво ще се случи там, какво ще намери героят...Но тя все пак остава в сюжета. Като надежда. Или като израз на това, че естествената ни природа е свързана с едни и същи неща - индентичността ни, миналото ни, което я е предопределило в различна степен, стремежа ни да разберем "кои сме", макар това да е толкова условно. И да няма смисъл. И да има смисъл. Но със сигурност реалността, каквато и да я намери героят, ще бъде извън чувството на меланхолия, на екзистенциална, безкрайна тъга, и със сигурност няма да я промени. Защото тя е втъкана в душата на героя, някъде много по-дълбоко от случилото се на границата, от загубата на Дьониз, от загубата на спомени, някъде, с извора на неговото "да бъда"...
256`3`Роман начинается как компьютерный квест. Ги Ролан работает в частном сыскном агентстве, и в один прекрасный день его начальник Хютте решает уйти на покой. Ги Ролан – не настоящее имя героя, его ему дал Хютте, когда выяснил, что новому работнику начисто отшибло память. Теперь восемь лет совместной работы завершились, и Ролан может наконец выяснить, кто он такой...И вот Ролан всю книгу ходит по Парижу, встречается с людьми, которые могли бы знать, кто он такой; за русскими эмигрантами мы попадаем в дома актрис, фотографов, жен дипломатов; отели, загородные особняки, бары, и герою все время кажется, что вот эту-то улицу он точно помнит, и у ворот этого дома он точно стоял – но его фантазии опять оказываются всего лишь выдумками воображения, и вот он дальше ищет зацепок в больших гроссбухах агентства...Была такая игра Amnesia, там потерявший память герой в сеттинге Германии середины XIX века блуждал по готическому замку, спасался бегством от каких-то мумифицированного вида монстров и пытался узнать, какие тайны спрятаны в замке. По ходу выясняется, что замок принадлежит потомку Агриппы, и потомок НЕ СОВСЕМ потомок, но в конечном итоге блуждания по жутковатым помещениям приходят к логическому завершению.А вот квест Ролана далек от завершения, и эти блуждания по лабиринтам памяти и пространства очень напоминают "Памяти памяти" Степановой – с той разницей, что у Степановой регистр художественной литературы в какой-то момент ломается и уступает место эссеистике, а у Модиано ничего подобного нет, квест прерывается лишь затем, чтобы герой вгляделся в очередной узор на занавесках и что-то там почувствовал.А эти диалоги. Когда официант... и дипломат... и жена дипломата... и фотограф... говорят... каждый... с таким... количеством... многоточий... то наверно... это... добавляет загадки...Кто-нибудь, намекните там Модиано, что это так не работает! Серьезно, 939 многоточий на небольшую книгу, господи, 939.Комитет в 2014 году заявил, что вручил Модиано премию"…За искусство памяти, благодаря которому он выявил самые непостижимые человеческие судьбы и раскрыл жизненный мир человека времен оккупации".Буллщит, ему ее дали за самое большое количество многоточий в истории литературы.А может быть, еще и за самый быстрый подкат в истории литературы. "— Извините, — сказал он, когда я сел за его столик в кафе на улице Бланш; по телефону он предложил мне встретиться здесь часов в шесть вечера. — Извините, но я всегда назначаю свидание где-нибудь в городе… Особенно в первый раз… Теперь мы можем пойти ко мне…"На месте Ролана я бы насторожился.Этот же самый чел (он фотограф) потом будет шарахаться от каждой улицы и переулка, мимо которого будет проходить, и еще выкатит целую телегу о том, как его друга-грека убил загадошный убийца.А теперь представьте, что в этой книжке каждый герой разговаривает, как накачавшаяся опиатами богема, и за каждым углом галлюцинирует собственным прошлым – и получите фанфик по Лавкрафту.В общем, да, Модиано – это такой Lovecraft meets Stepanova.Топ 10 аниме кроссоверов в истории, обожаю.
257`3`починається все як нуар із французьким присмаком: власник детективного агентства вирішує, що пора на пенсію, і їде з парижа, залишаючи своєму помічникові контору й останню нерозгадану загадку. не клієнтську. ця загадка – цілковито про помічника, який не може згадати, ким же він раніше був.уже тут, на перших сторінках, стає зрозуміло, що це буде вкрай філософський детектив. уся книжка – поступове розкопування минулого, збирання спогадів, спроба відтворити втрачену ідентичність. у прагненні до реконструкції свого життя наратор опиняється між "знати" й "відчувати": спершу йому вдається віднаходити тільки інформацію, а відчуття того, що "щось у мені стрепенулося", виявляється хибне, пов'язане з теперішнім "я", а не з попереднім; однак потім пам'ять потихеньку повертається (втім, тільки про те, уламки чого героєві вже вдалося відшукати, тож хто зна, чи то не сконструойвані образи), а з нею повертається слабкий, та все ж зв'язок між знаннями й відчуттями. занадто багато, однак, – і через це "вулиця темних крамниць" нагадує, наприклад, "нью-йоркську трилогію" остера – залишається в тумані. наче йдеш вечірньою вулицею, крамниці на якій уже давно замкнені, й можеш тільки зазирати у вітрини – але й там бачиш небагато, бо тобі весь час заважає твоє власне відображення в шибах (так, назва книжки дуже метафорична).модіано пише десь між класичним нуаром і експериментами абсурдистів, екзистенціалістів чи нових романістів, але, здається, в нього є всього потрошку. тому непросто визначитися з горизонтом очікувань і з тим, чи він цьому горизонтові відповідає. чи принаймні з тим, які відчуття залишає його текст (боюся, то в мене звична проблема з новим романом).

264`3`التيه... تدور فكرة الرواية وتفاصيلها حول التيه... حول البحث عن الذات في وسط هذا العالم المنظم جدًا والمليء بالفوضى أيضًا...لكنك في وسط كل تلك الرحلة لهذه الشخصية المحورية الفاقدة للذاكرة والتي تبحث عن كل شيء عنها في عيون وقلوب ورؤوس وأوراق وتاريخ الآخرين وتلملم بازل نفسها من هنا وهناك .. تكتشف أن كل هؤلاء الآخرين ضائعون.. هم أيضًا خرائط غير مكتملة لحيوات ممزقة لاتعرف عن نفسها الكثير... وفي طيات الحكي ووسط إقناعه لك أنه يجد نفسه يفاجئك أنه متشكك في كل شيء وأن حياته التي بدأت تتضح أمامه شيئًا فشيئًا قد لاتكون حياته بل قد تكون حياة آخر اقتحمتها روحه دون أن تدري وتملكتها بوضع اليد...وتظل في النهاية كل الحكايات ناقصة.. بما فيها حكايتنا نحن..هذا ويبقى للاسم عبقريته... فشارع الحوانيت المعتمة لايعني سوى الدنيا والحياة التي نعيش ... والحوانيت المعتمة ليست سوى نحن.. علامات الاستفهام التي تظل أحيانًا بلا إجابة حتى النهاية...
265`3`اول رواية اقرأها للكاتب الفرنسي صاحب جائزة نوبل لهذا العام ...فكرة الرواية وهدفها كان واضح عن الاحداث السياسية الي صارت بهداك الوقت مشكلة الرواية احداثها البطيئة وعدم وجود اسلوب تشويق يشد القارئ للمتابعة رغم عدد صفحاتها القليل الا اني بذلت مجود لحتى انتهيت منها .. سيكون لي عودة مع باتريك موديناو في رواية اخرى
266`3`بالصدفة البحتة وانا ابحث امس ف مكتبتى عن كتاب او رواية قليلة الحجم لأقرأها ف الليل وجدت رواية " شارع الحوانيت المعتمة " ولم ألتفت كثيراً إلى اسم الكاتب إلا ف نصف الرواية عندما فوجئت انه من فاز بجائزة نوبل الآداب هذا العام واننى قد قمت بشراء تلك الرواية من خلال معرض الكتاب 2014 ! فكرة الرواية رائعة والتى تدور حول رجل فقد الذاكرة وعمل ف مكتب تحريات خاص واعطاه صاحبه اسم جديد بأوراق شخصية جديدة ولكن يقرر الفاقد للذاكرة البحث عن ماضيه ومن هو .وتتوالى الاحداث ف اسلوب يشبه لعبة البازل تقوم بتركيب اجزاءها بشكل متتالى لتتضح الحقيقة شيئا فشيئا .لا أنكر ان الرواية شدتنى بشكل كبير وإن كان هناك شعور انتابنى بمجرد الانتهاء منها بأن هناك شيئاً خاطئاً أو شيئاً ناقصاً فى الرواية ،، ربما يعود ذلك إلى قلة عدد صفحاتها وشعورى بأن النهاية غريبة بعض الشئ أو ان الاحداث اتت بشكل متسارع !نصيحة لمن ينوى قراءة تلك الرواية أن ينتهى منها خلال جلسة واحدة حتى لا يتوه وسط الأحداث واسماء الشخصيات !لا أعلم سر منح باتريك جائزة نوبل بالرغم من قراءتى الأولى له لم تجعلنى أشعر بأنه يستحق ذلك فهناك الأفضل منه بكل تأكيد ،، ولكن لن اتسرع ف اعطاء حكمى النهائى إلا بقراءة عمل آخر له " مجهولات " .التقييم النهائى : 3/5 من 5
267`4`بنام پیوند دهنده قلبها (^.^)در دومین روز ورودم به دومین ربع‌قرن زندگی ام با کتابی عجیب مواجه شدم که ذهنم رو مشغول خودش کرد. "به راستی آدمی چیزی جز خاطراتش است؟"برای خیلی از آدمهایی که میشناسم ، خاطرات همه چیزشونه. بدون آنها خودشون رو مرده متحرک میدونن ، نوستالوژی ها هویتشون رو تعریف میکنن و بعضی ها حتی فقط در گذشته زندگی میکنن..ولی من بدم نمیاد حافظه ام رو از دست بدم ، در واقع بخشی از خاطرات گذشته رو از یاد ببرم فقط ، اون بخش من کی هستم ، دوستانم ، عشق ها و تمام آدمها رو ... اینطوری فکر میکنم میتونم دوباره از اول زندگی کنم. در شروع ۲۶ سالگی به شروع دوباره فکر میکنم ، بدم نمیاد به شکل اجباری و بدون پیش فرض دوباره شروع به شناخت خودم و آدمهای اطرافم کنم و بنظرم این میتونه مثل دوباره متولد شدن باشه :)) البته میدونم تا حد زیادی احمقانه اس ولی خب حس خوبی بهش دارم ...کتاب جذابی بود با پایان اصغر فرهادی طوری...
268`3`بیشتر از کتاب هایی خوشم میاد که آخرش یه پایانی داشته باشه و به یه جایی برسه و یا حداقل بفهمم چه اتفاقی برای شخصیت ها افتاده ؟کتاب خوبی بود ، و خوب جایزه بزرگ گنکور رو هم گرفته و پاتریک مودیانو هم شخصیت بزرگی توی ادبیات فرانسه و جهان هست ، اما من تا خود صفحه آخر منتظر بودم بفهمم برای رولاند چه اتفاقی افتاده وقتی میخواستن از مرز خارج بشن چی شده ؟ واز همه مهم تر اصلا چرا میخواستن از فرانسه خارج بشن؟ ولی خب کتاب تموم شد و جواب این سوالات رو پیدا نکردم ، ولی در کل کتاب جالبی بود و ترجمه اش هم ازین ترجمه های خسته کننده نبود که همش میخوای کتاب رو زمین بذاری!

270`5`تقاطعتُ أول مرة مع موديانو قبل أشهر من فوزه بنوبل، حينما ذكره بيتر هاندكه كأحد الفرنسيين الذين قام بترجمتهم إلى الألمانية. ولكنني حينها لم أبالي كثيرا بملاحقته. ثم فاز بنوبل، وكذلك لم أبالي كثيرا بملاحقته (يجب ألا تجعل الجوائز تتحكم في توجيهك القرائي فضلا عن أن تثق بها أصلا). ثم صادفته في قائمة الأسماء التي تتلمذت على يد ريمون كينو، أحد مجانين السرد في فرنسا أثناء أربعينيات القرن العشرين. فكرة اهتمام طفيفة تتكوّن. ثم قرأت أخيرا إشارة من الألماني سيبالد يذكر فيها قدرة موديانو على النفوذ إلى الذاكرة بدقة حميمية حلمية. ولأن سيبالد يعتبر من أفضل كتاب الذاكرة، تشكلت فكرة الاهتمام بموديانو بشكل نهائي. ولكن قبله، لا بد أن أعود إلى مارسيل بروست. لا بدّ دائما أن تعود إلى مارسيل بروست مع الفرنسيين. لماذا موديانو إذاً؟ لماذا يقدم كوارث شرعي لبروست؟بروست من أمهر من تعاملوا مع الذاكرة. الذاكرة البانورمية التي يتم تفكيكها إلى فسيفساء مدببة من الاستطرادات والتشابك والتيه. كل عضلة تستجيب عصبيا لحركة السارد اللامقصودة تدفعه إلى استرجاع ذكرى تقاطعت مع ذات العضلة، أوتوماتيكيا. ذاكرة بروست حسية وإجبارية بدرجة كبيرة، وكأن الشخص مجموعة ذكريات تتحكم في المسار الحاضر. ولذا لا يوجد ما هو حاضر، كل شيء انعكاس للماضي، فالحاضر ليس إلا تكرار حدوث الماضي كما يقول أوجين أونيل. ولهذا يُعبِّـر عنها بتدفق تأملي وشعري كثيف. موديانو ذهب بالذاكرة إلى مسار مختلف، مسار الانفصال عوضا عن المحسوس. الذاكرة محرك خارجي يعمل خارج الذات. الشخص في هذه الرواية لا يتذكر من يكون، لا يعرف شيئا من ماضيه القديم، تخدعه الصور والشكوك التي تقنعه ببساطة أنه كان ما يراه الآن، ثم يكتشف لاحقا أنه لم يكن. حتى الشكل، ملامح الوجه، الصورة الحسية لك، لا يمكن الثقة بها، معرضة للتشابه الذي قد يخدعك حينما تقتنع أنك ترى وجهك في صورة فوتوغرافية لشخص ما ثم تكتشف لاحقا أنك لم تكن هو. الذاكرة لدى موديانو متاهة من الانفصال، من اللاانتماء، من الفجوة التي تفصل بين الحاضر والماضي. موديانو يعكس معادلة بروست ويؤكد أننا لسنا الماضي، وإنما الماضي هو الكذبة الكبيرة المشكوك في وجودها، ولذا شخصياته مجوفة، مفرغة من انتمائها، جميعهم يتذكرون ماضيهم وكأنه لم يكن، وكأنه شيء حدث خارج محيط ذاتهم، وهو ما يجعلهم يفقدون شعورهم بذاتهم، فما هي هذه الذات؟! من أنا؟! موديانو يُعمّق سؤال كافكا القديم: هل أنا نفسي فعلا أم صنع مني الآخرون الشخص الذي أنا عليه؟! ويطرح سؤالا معاكسا: هل أنا الذي صنع مني الآخرون الشخص الذي أنا عليه؟! هل أنا فعلا ما أنا عليه الآن؟! شخصيات موديانو عبارة عن بخار، طيف، جملة أوصاف حسية قابلة للتلاشي مع أول نفثة هواء. الذاكرة لدى الألماني سيبالد مختلفة أيضا. إنه يتناول الذاكرة بعقلية محقق، تحرّي. الذاكرة لديه مرادف للتاريخ، حيث أنها جملة من الأحداث والصور الموثقة واللاموثقة. ولذا سيبالد في روايته يخترق الذاكرة وكأنها شارع تسير فيه وتسجل معلومات البيوت على حافته: اللون، الحجم، المظهر، الأشخاص. سيبالد في حلقات زحل يخترق الريف الإنجليزي ويتحدث عن الموسوعيّ توماس براون وقصرٍ أرستقراطيٍّ فقد بريقه ليتحول إلى متحف ومطاحنٍ قديمة على حافة شواطئ مهجورة وأكاديميين زاملهم في فترة ما. سيبالد يتعامل مع الذاكرة كأكاديمي فوقي، يسجل ملاحظاته ويتوارى سريعا بصمت. ولكنه يتوه تماما كما يتوه موديانو وبروست، ولكن توهانه يأتي من كونه ليس مهتما بالاكتشاف الذاتي، بالتوثيق المصيري. إنه منفصل عن الذاكرة، يعاملها كمستودع محايد للمعلومات، ولذا يضيع كل شيء عدا المعلومة، ويبدو وكأنه يخوض في حلم. هو أقل حميمية ولكنه أكثر بانورامية، وإن جاز لي القول أكثر عمقا. شخصيات موديانو بسيطة، لديها نزعة أوتوماتيكية للتحدث عن ذكرياتها، لا يتعب البطل في محاولة استخراج ما يحتاجه من معلومات، لأن الجميع متورط في رغبة الحديث عما كان. شخصيات موديانو متورطة جدا رغم أنها تريد الانفصال بتناقض، إنها الحراك الوجداني للذاكرة الفردية المثقلة، الذاكرة التي تكاد ترى آثار صورها الدخانية على كل الشوارع والأسطح والبيوت التي مرت بها. وأنت تقرأ الرواية ستشعر بذلك فعلا، بأن كل مكان يمر به البطل تبدو على أسطحه صور كل ما مر به، حتى صورة البطل نفسه تبخر منه إلى المكان لتنضم إلى البقية، في حفلة دخان باهت هو الذي يسبب شحوب الأماكن القديمة التي نرتادها: إنه شحوب ذكرياتنا كلنا. ذاكرة موديانو موغلة في الكآبة، الحزن الرتيب الذي يطبع الأشياء التي تقف فوق الأرصفة برثاثة أزلية، تُـكرر تيه انعدام قدرة الاكتشاف والقبض على شيء ما. شخصيات حزينة، موغلة في الحزن الجامد مثل الوجه الذي تصحّر بفعل الشيخوخة حتى اختفت ملامحه، أو تكاد. شخصيات مظلمة تعيش في ظلٍّ شاحب وتحاول قدر المستطاع أن تثبت لنفسها وللآخر أنها "تتذكر" بأن تسرد ذكرياتها المشوشة. هنالك ثقل تطهيري في هذه الرواية، ثقل الوحدة التي يشعر بها كل واحد منا حينما يتذكر شيئا قديما يؤكد له أنه يشيخ وأن ما ذهب لن يعود وأن بقية حياته تكرار لهذا: أشياء تجيء ثم تذهب ولا تعود، ولا يبقى منها شيء كما يقول البطل ولو حتى سحابة الضوء المنبعثة من دودة براقة. هذه الرواية ألم لطيف، ألم ضروري. والأهم: ألم نقي. لا يحاول فرض نفسه، لا يشرعن وجوده بشعرية اكسسواراتية. إنه أكثر حدة من أن يكون مزيفا، أكثر رتابة من أن لا يكون أصيلا. إنه كما يفترض من الذاكرة المثقلة أن تكون. الاستسلام الشاحب المستقر في الظل، ينتظر مصيرا يشبه الانطفاء. 
271`2`تقول ألكساندرا شوارتز كاتبة مقال في النيويوركر عن باتريك موديانو وقد ترجمه محمد عبدالنبي لجريدة القاهرة: أنه من الممكن ألا يكون موديانو مؤلف سيمفونيات .. ولكنه بالتأكيد عازف بيانو رائع وأنا أتفق معها .. وأضيف أن روايات موديانو -في ظني- تفتقر للإبداع وتحافظ على ثيمة واحدة وهو ما يتناسب مع قولها أنه عازف رائع ولكن العمل الادبي يحتاج إلى مؤلف موسيقي حقيقي وليس مجرد عازف ماهر ..
272`4`داستان با موضوعی شروع می‌شه که به نظرم میاد یه زمان خیلی سوژه‌ی رایجی بوده ولی بعدا بازارش کساد شد: فراموشی‌گذشته.مردی که راه میفته تا هویت واقعی خودش رو بعد سال‌ها کشف کنه. تو این مسیر آدم‌های زیادی رو هم می‌کشونه به یه زمان دیگه. آدم‌هایی مطلقا غریبه که در مواجهه با قهرمان داستان بخش‌های غبارگرفته‌ای از خاطراتشون رو بیرون می‌کشن و انگار تو این روند دنبال چیزهایی از شخصیت خودشون می‌گردن. تو این گفتگوها معلوم نیست کدوم طرف داره به اون‌یکی کمک می‌کنه. شنونده‌ای که به هر دری می‌زنه تا ردی از خودش پیدا کنه، سریع هر داستانی رو باور می‌کنه و خودش رو در مرکز قرار می‌ده؛ یا گوینده‌ای که انگار باری رو سال‌ها با خودش حمل کرده، نیاز داشته اون‌ها رو منتقل کنه و بعد با خیال راحت از زندگی حذف‌شون کنه. این موضوع که شخصیت به هیچ‌کس درباره‌ی قصد اصلیش حرفی نمی‌زنه (هرچند تا حدی غیرقابل‌درک برای من)، این دوگانگی رو پررنگ‌تر هم کرده.روایت داستان خطی نیست، اما لحن و هیجانش چرا. مطلقا خطی و یکنواخت. تا جایی که لحظه‌ی حل معما با لحظات توصیف پنجره‌ی یه ساختمون تفاوت چندانی به لحاظ لحن و سرعت ندارن. اتفاق‌ها صرفا میفتن. همین! و این‌جور نوشتن داستانی که توش فراموشی و جنگ و فرار و عشق هست، در نوع خودش جالبه.در نهایت هم تعلیق ماجرا تموم نمی‌شه. داستان تمام تکه‌های پازل رو می‌ذاره کنار هم و باز تاکید می‌کنه که ممکنه همه‌ی این‌ها اشتباه باشه. نظر به شباهتش به زندگی واقعی، حقیقت هولناکیه.حجم کتاب هم اندازه بود. همچین پرداختی همین‌قدر صحبت رو می‌طلبید و نه بیشتر.اگر دنبال کتابی هستید که شب از هیجان بیدار نگه‌تون داره، خیابان بوتیک‌های خاموش انتخاب بی‌نهایت اشتباهی خواهد بود.
273`2`داستان در مورد شخصیه که هویت خودش رو به یاد نمیاره و با جستجو در خاطرات و اسناد به دنبال اینه که بدونه چه کسی بوده.دومین کتابی بود که از مودیانو می‌خوندم و از اولی (برای اینکه در محله گم نشوی) بهتر بود ولی فکر نکنم دیگه سراغ کتابی از این نویسنده برم. کسل‌کننده شروع شد، یک جاهایی حدود یک سوم میانی، داستان جالب شد. اوج داستان برام جایی بود که یک نفر تمام آلبوم‌های عکسش که به نظرم کنایه به خاطرات داشت رو به غریبه‌ای می‌بخشه. ولی در ادامه تکرار مکررات حوصله‌م رو سر برد.پایان‌بندی کتاب رو دوست داشتم. جمله پایانی خیلی زیاد با متن داستان هماهنگ و در حکم عصاره بود.+ متاسفانه کتاب کمیابه و نسخه چاپیش ممکنه به سختی گیر بیاد. من از روی اپ کتابخوان فراکتاب، نسخه‌ی ای‌پابش رو خوندم.----------یادگاری از کتاب:همه چیز بین «آدم های دنیا» اتفاق افتادنی ست....شاید چیزی، پاره‌ای از زندگی‌ام، آنجا پیش كسی، درون آپارتمانی در حاشیه‌ی باغچه‌ها كه هنوز به یادم می‌آید، باقی مانده باشد....آیا حیات ما نیز به همان سرعتِ این اندوهِ كودكانه در دل غروب ناپدید می‌شود؟
274`4`داستان همچون کابوسی است نرم و آهسته و طولانی در مه با تصاویری که پس از بیداری تا ساعت‌ها در ذهن رژه می‌رود و تا روزها در ذهن می‌ماند. و آدم‌هایی که از دل تاریکی می‌آیند و در دل برف و سرما و بی سرانجام ناپدید می‌شوند. آدم‌هایی که هیچ نیستند مگر نیمرخی ضدنور در بالکن کافه‌ای بارانی... برخلاف ترجمه ضعیف (هرچند روان) در این کتاب بیش از دیگر آثار مودیانو شناور شدم.
275`3`رحلة للبحث عنك أو عني أو عنه لا يهم من أكون أو تكون أو يكون طالما أنه فطن لأن حياة كل منا تمر سريعا كحزن طفلة أجبرتها أمها على ترك الشاطئ والعودة بينما هي تريد أن تستمر في لهوهاحزن لطيف ضئيل سرعان ما ينتهي ظل بطل موديانو يتجول بنا في شوارع باريس فنادق وشقق ، بارات قطارات، كنائس بحثا عمن يكون بعد أن فقد ذاكرته مستغلا عمله السابق وعلاقته بمخبر سري قرر أن يترك كل شيء ويعود لبلدته نيس آملا أن يكون أمينا لكتبة الكنيسة لكنه لم يكف عن مد يد المساعدة لصديقه الذي يبحث عن نفسه وعمن يكون وأعظم مفارقة أنه حين عرف من هو عرف أيضا أن الاسم الذي توصل إليه اسما مزيفا وأن من يعرفه حقيقة قرر قبل أن يتوصل إليه أن ينتهي في جزيرة لا يصل إليه أحد فيها أو يعتقدون أنه مات ليبق البطل بلا هوية حقيقية بعد أن استغل عمله السابق في مفوضية الدومنيك للحصول على جواز سفر باسم وجنسية مزيفين لعبور الحدود لكنه لم يعبر ولم يعرف ماذا حدث بعد أن تركه نصاب بين الثلوج وأخذ آخر زوجته فافترق عنها ولم يلتقيا ولم يهتدي كأنه يرسم الدنيا من خلال عقل فقد كل ذاكرته فهي انتقالات وارتحالات ناس نعرفها وأخرى تسقط وهكذا قد نعود مثل المخبر للمنبت وقد لا نعود ونظل لا نعرف من نحن هل نجد أنفسنا أم نتوه عنها ؟!ترك موديانو الطريق بلا تأكيد لأن لا أحد يمكنه أن يؤكد هل حقا نعرف أنفسنا أم أننا سنظل في رحلة بحث متاهة حقيقية كتلك التي صادفها البطل في قصر صديقه !
276`3`رواية غريبة، فيها الكثير من الضياع والبحث وتشبه لعبة تجميع القطع لتشكيل لوحة، متعبة للقارئ إلى حد كبير... قرأتها للاطلاع على نتاج الفائز بجائزة نوبل للآداب لهذا العام 2014، ولكن مازلت أحبذ روايات مارغريت دوراس، فهي تحمل نوعاً مماثلاً من التشويق، ولكن أكثر وضوحاً والشخصيات محددة المعالم على نحو أفضل.
277`4`رواية مشوقة تقوم على فكرة البحث عن الذات والهويةرحلة بحث يحاول فيها بطل الرواية استرداد ذاكرته المفقودةلكشف أحداث الماضي ومعرفة حقيقة شخصيتهكل خطوة في طريق البحث تقوده لأماكن وشخصيات مختلفة يجمع الحكايات والأحداث والصور ليُرمم الذاكرة المعتمةويختم موديانو روايته بمواصلة متاهة البحث وكأنها أحد ضرورات الوجود الانساني
278`4`سبک قلم نویسنده رو دوست داشتم و موضوع داستان هم جالب بود. طوری که کشش داشت بخوای تندتر بخونی و بفهمی هویت نقش اصلی کی بوده و در انتها داستان یک‌جورایی باز تموم می‌شه ولی به‌نظرم پایان خوبی بود و البته ناراحت کننده...
279`4`ستاره‌اش بین سه و چهاره.هیچ وقت با موضوع به دنبال هویت خود گشتن که موضوع کتاب‌های زیادیه احساس نزدیکی نکردم. برای همین ستاره‌هاش کم شد. اما ساختار کتاب و شیوه نویسندگی‌اش رو دوست داشتم.
280`3`شارع الحوانيت المعتمة ترجمة : محمد عبد المنعم جلالاقتنيتها منذ فترة وأثناء ترتيب بعض الكتب تفاجأت إني أملك رواية لباتريك موديانو الحاصل علي نوبل 2014 فكان لابد من قراءتهاففي شارع الحوانيت المعتمة تبدأ الرواية بانتهاء البطل وصديقه من العمل في مكتب التحريات الخاصةويبدأ صديقه بالهجرة ويبدأ البطل الذي كان يدعي "جوي" ولكن هذا لم يكن إسمه الحقيقي فهذا اسم وبعض أوراق خاصة كانت قد انتهي منها صديقه ليثبت له شخصيته بعدما وجده فاقد للهوية والاسم والشخصية نفسهافكانت بدأ برحلاته للبحث عن نفسه تمتعت بالرواية وأسلوبها الذي يشبه البازل في تجميع حياته اسم من كل بيت وعنوان من كل مدينة ويجمعهمولكن كان يرواده سؤال ما "هل هذه البيانات تبعي أم إنني اقتحمت حياة اخر"شعرت بالملل بسبب الافراط في التفاصيل والسرد أثناء البحث عن نفسه وكثرة الأسماء والعناوين التي كان يتلقاها ويذهب إليهاأشعر أن الرواية نقصت شيئا ما ربما كان الترجمة هي ماأنقصته ولكن رائعة ربما للفكرة ربما للأسلوب الذي كان ينقص ّّ!!
281`5`عالی بود. پاتریک مودیانو خیلی خوب در این داستان توانست مخاطب را با خودش همراه کند. گاهی به طرز وحشتناکی با خودم گفتم اگر یک روز گذشته ات را فراموش کنی چه می شود؟! گاهی پاک کردن گذشته زیباست و آرام بخش و گاهی وحشتناک! عجیب احساس همذات پنداری با "رولاند" شخصیت اول این رمان کردم.این جمله ش هم که "گذشته بسیار مهمتر از آینده است" من را به فکر وا می دارد... واقعا گذشته مهمتر است یا حال؟! به نظر می رسد که اگر گذشته زیبا و خوشایند باشد مهم خواهد بود وگرنه حال مهمتر است.
282`4`في رواية شارع المتاجر المظلمة الصادرة عام 1972م، وهي الفائزة بجائزة الغونكور الأدبية الفرنسية المرموقة، تظهر لنا شخصية تعمل في سلك التحقيقات الخاصة، يبدأ بمهمة غريبة وفريدة من نوع مختلف؛ يقرر البحث عن حقيقة نفسه، أن يعرف من هو على أرض الواقع وما اسمه وما هي هويته. شخص فقد الذاكرةـ، تربى عند شخصية أخرى ساعدته على تخطي أزمته العقلية وعمل معه، ثم قرر أن يبحث عن هويته الحقيقية بعد سنوات من الضياع. هذه الشخصية في رحلتها للبحث عن هويتها الحقيقية تسير دون بينة، تحمل دلائل بسيطة تقود إلى مناطق وشوارع وشقق ومنازل وطرق. كل هذه تحمل ذكريات عميقة لا تزول. كل منها يشكل دليلاً حياً أن هناك كائن حي، إنسان قد مر من هنا وشكل جزءاً من ذاكرته. لكن أين هي الذاكرة لرجل يبحث عن ذاكرة؟ عن ماضي لا يُعرف؟ ما إن يتلبس هوية جديدة ويجدها مناسبة له، حتى يفقد أساس وجوده وينتقل إلى هوية أخرى، هوية بعد هوية، ثم ماذا؟ باتريك موديانو لا يبحث عن حل لأزمة بطله. لكنها مثال حي لكل ما يحبه موديانو وما تفضله تقنياته: الشوارع، الذاكرة، الهوية.
283`5`في شارع الحوانيت المعتمة يقودنا باتريك موديانو صحبة جوي في رحلة بحث عن هويته التي انمحت منذ عشر سنوات خلت، لتتركه ضائعا في التيه، باحثا عن ذاته. يدخل جوي درب الحوانيت المعتمة مستعينا بضوء حانة، ليخرج منها ممسكا بأول الخيط الذي يقوده عبر بقيتها نحو وجهته الأخيرة....شارع الحوانيت المعتمة.يقول موديانو عن نفسه بأنه يمتلك أسلوبا فقيرا بدون وقع تأثير يذكر، ويبدو في هذا أنه قد أغفل عددا من وجهات نظر ناقديه التي سلمت بأنه يمتلك أسلوبه الخاص هذا عدا كونه رائدا للموديانية، إضافة إلى آراء الألوف من قرائه التي تهامست بعبقريته. هذه الرواية كتبت في عام 1978 ورغم ذلك فإن بريق روعتها لا يزال صارخا.مجموعة صور يمتلكها من لم يقابل جوي يوما، عقد زواج لإمرأة تحمل ملامح آسيوية، عدد من أرقام لهواتف في روما واليونان وفرنسا وعدد مماثل لها من عناوين.... كومة من أوراق قد لا تعني شيئا لمن يعثر عليها لكنها فعلا قد تكمل ما ينقص جوي
284`3`من هیچم .هیچ ، جز نیمرخ رنگ پریده ای در تراس یک کافه ی غروب زده.خوندن این کتاب میتونست تجربه ی لذت بخشی برام باشه اما تمام این مدت توی کوچه ها خیابونا و سالن های ناشناخته ی شهر پاریس سرگردون بودم دلم هوس خیابونای اشنای تهرانو کرده بود .
285`2`من هیچم. هیچ جز شبحی روشن...)
286`null`مودیانو بدون آنکه فلسفه پردازی کند، نشان می دهد که زندگی ما چیزی جز پازل هایی از خاطرات دور دست و یا نزدیک نیست. خاطراتی که بسیاری از آنها در گذر زمان رنگ می بازند. شرایطی که حتی انسان دچار تردید می شود که آیا بازیگر آن رویدادها او بوده است یا دیگری؟ زبان داستان بسیار ساده و روان است. از لحاظ کشش، بوتیک خیابان های خاموش، را می شود ظرف دو سه روز خواند و این نشانه خوبی است برای یک اثر! وقتی آخرین کلمه کتاب را میخوانی احساس بدی درباره نوع پایان بندی آن نخواهی داشت. از جمله ویژگی های کتاب، اشاره(شاید بیش از حد) به نام خیابانها، سالنها، کافه هاو... پاریس است انگار که قراردادی با شهرداری امضا کرده باشد. البته این نامها در روند اصلی داستان غالبا کاربرد دارند. ویژگی مهم دیگر در این کتاب تعدد روای است: دانای کل، اول شخص و یک روای دیگر که «زبان اسناد» است. در این زبان اسناد یک بخش دو صفحه ای به انعکاس کامل یک سند و حتی یک آدرس ساده اختصاص داده شده است که در اصل روای این بخشها، اول شخص است. 
287`1`نمیدونم چی شد که انقدر طول دادم خوندنش رو و فکر میکنم همین باعث شد حق مطلب به درستی ادا نشه و من که همیشه دوست داشتم این کتاب رو بخونم میشد که هفته‌ای یکبار برم سراغش و چند صفحه ایش رو ورق بزنم شاید باید یکبار دیگه سر حوصله بفهممش چون در حال حاضر انگار که هیچی نه فهمیده‌م و نه یادم مونده ازش حتی انقدر ازش اطلاعی بدست نیاورده‌م که نمیدونم دلیل جذب نشدنم خودم بودم یا روایت کتاب
288`4`نگاهي بر كتاب خيابان بوتيك ها خاموش اثر پاتريك موديانو: اجازه بديد اين نقدو با حسي شروع كنم كه در زمان اتمام كتاب بهم دست داد. مثل خيلي از كتاباي ديگه اين هم تموم شد اما با دقت ورق آخرشو با انگشتاي سبابه و شستم لمس ميكردم و انتظار عجيبي براي پيدا كردن صفحه اي داشتم كه احتمالا به صفحه ي آخر چسبيده بود، ولي هرگز ورق ديگه اي در كار نبود. بايد مخاطب اين واقعيتو تحمل كنه كه داستان به انتهاي خودش رسيده.مثل بوق سهمگين و ممتد يه قطار نيمه شب كه در انتهاي مدت توقف خودش مجبوره جاشو به سكوت سنگين شب يك كوير بده. تموم شده بود ماجرايي كه شايد هنوز شروع هم نشده. نويسنده دست شخصيت داستان رو از هيچ بيرون ميكشه، اونو به دنياي اطرافش نشون ميده، هر لحظه شناختشو از هويت و خاطراتش بيشتر ميكنه و در نهايت در يك بن بست اونو دوباره به دام ميندازه. داستان با جرقه اي بسيار ساده آغاز ميشه و هنر نويسنده به اينه كه تا حد زيادي روند كتاب رو به صورت غير خطي به نگارش درآورده. مردي كه سهمي از گذشته نداره و در جستجوي مرهمي از نوع خاطرات به دنبال سرنخ ميگرده اون هم تو شهر پاريس. بله تصوير سازي پاريس. موديانوي فرانسوي به بهترين شكل ممكن از پاريسي حرف ميزنه كه خواننده در هر صفحه احساس ميكنه كه در حال سفري به كوچه پس كوچه هاي اونه. موديانو از هيچ توصيفي كه برانگيزاننده ي حس همدردي با شخصيت داستان در خواننده باشه، غفلت نكرده. دنياي زنده ي اين رمان يكي از عناصري هست كه با آغوشي باز شخصيت داستانو در خودش جاي داده و زمينه ي مناسب رو براي يك گردش اجباري در زمان و مكان فراهم ميكنه. و حال چرا زمان؟مرز واقعيت و خيال در اين رمان از بين رفته و گاهي كاراكتر اصلي خودش رو غوطه ور در زماني از يك مكان مشخص و بالعكس ميبينه كه بعضي از اون خاطرات هرگز به وقوع نپيوستن و اينا صرفا تكاپويي بي ثمر براي يادآوري كوچكترين حوادث زندگيش بودن. شايد به همين دليله كه ترجمه ي انگليسي اين كتاب به "ميسينگ پرسن" به معادل فارسيش شخص گمشده شهرت پيدا كرده كه البته خيابان بوتيكهاي خاموش قطعا حسي مبهم و خاطره انگيز تر ايجاد ميكنه. به هر حال بايد بگم كه از اين نويسنده قطعا در آينده دوباره كتابهايي خواهم خوند كه هر چي بيشتر با صحنه سازي هاي مختص به سبك خودش آشنا بشم. فضاهايي كه بوي فراموشي ميدن.
289`3`وای وای چقدر عجیب بود و دوست‌داشتنی.. چه سیال بود این کتاب. مرموز و غمگین و گم‌شده. تلوتلوخوران در خیابان تاریک و خیس. نحوه‌ی روایتش فوق‌العاده برایم جذاب بود. داستانی که تقریباً به هیچ‌جا نمی‌رسد

291`3`پایان داستان را دوست نداشتم. کتاب بدی نبود اما خیلی جذاب و دوست‌داشتنی هم نبود. ضمن این‌که هنگام خواندنش نباید وقفه‌ی طولانی بین خواندن بیفتد، و گرنه سررشته‌ی داستان از دست خواننده در می‌رود.
292`3`پایانشو خیلی دوست داشتم. همچنین تعهّد نویسنده در مورد شهری نوشتن. ترسیم چهره‌ی پاریس، آدمای پاریسی و جریانات پاریسی و نتیجتاً، یه‌داستان پاریسی. داستان، تعلیق خیلی خوبی داشت؛ هم به‌لحاظ فرمی و ساختاری، هم محتوایی. با این‌که من کلاً با شخصیّت‌ها خیلی ارتباط برقرار نمی‌کردم و تا به‌حال دو کتابی که از پاتریک مودیانو خوندم، همین‌اندازه شبح‌گونه و مبهم بودن.. ولی، این‌ابهام ضربه نمی‌زنه و می‌تونیم بگیم شاید سبکشه حتّی. قسمت مهمّش این بود که با وجود این‌همه گره و مسئله و سرنخ‌های مختلف، نویسنده رشته‌ی داستانو گم نمی‌کرد! این خیلی مهمّه؛ بخصوص تو چنین داستانایی که اون‌قــد نشونه‌ها زیادن که ممکنه خود ِ نویسنده هم بعد یه‌مدّت، نتونه اون‌جور که باید و شاید، از خلالشون داستانو پیش ببره و بهم ربطشون بده. بهشون بگیم داستانای زنجیره‌‍ای؛ گرچه اسم بهتری می‌طلبن.
293`4`کتاب با این جمله شروع میشه:من هیچم. هیچ، جز نیم رخ رنگ پریده ای در تراس یک کافه ی غروب زده.و با این جمله تموم میشه:آیا حیات ما نیز به همان سرعت این اندوه کودکانه در دل غروب ناپدید میشود؟و تمام کتاب بین همین دو جمله میگذره.
294`4`کتاب رو دوست داشتم جز آخرش. بیشتر شبیه فیلم بود البته تا کتاب. به خاطر این که رفیق مون برنده نوبل شده خوندمش و پشیمون نیستم ولی کاش آخرش رو سر هم بندی نمی‌کرد.
295`4`کتابجزو کتاب‌هایی بود که به سختی می‌تونستم زمین بذارمش. پر از تعریف‌هایی زیبا از پاریس، این جنبه مثبت از کتاب رو در کتاب “در سیدخندان کسی را نمی‌کشند” نوشته مهام میقانی در مورد تهران دیده بودم. در کل این شکل شناخت شهر و تعریف کوچه و خیابان‌های اون برام جالبه. درمورد کند و کاو درمورد گذشته توسط فردی که فراموشی گرفته و حالا قدم به قدم، سرنخ به سرنخ به دنبال گذشته خود است.ترجمه ساسان تبسمی می‌تونست از این بهتر هم باشه.
296`4`‘Scraps, shreds have come to light as a result of my searches…But then that is perhaps what a life amounts to.’It seems fitting that a fog has just rolled in as I began writing here. Fog, an essential element to the atmosphere of noir and the essence of Missing Person by 2014’s Nobel Prize of Literature recipient Patrick Modiano. Here is a mystery where everything is shrouded in fog from the evening Paris streets to the narrator’s own memory; Modiano has created a mystery where the detective is the subject of his own case as he tracks down his past lost in a haze of amnesia. Through his purely elegant, lyrical prose, Paris comes alive in a maze of ever changing streets and people who watch the Paris of their pasts, the restaurants and hotels that form the settings of their identity, drift into unreachable oblivion. Through a sleek noir dredging up the shadowy streets of Nazi occupied France, Modiano muses on identity in a world that continuously mutates into the future and finds our only evidence of existence diminishing with the deaths of those who once knew us as another generation passes into silence.‘Is it really my life I’m tracking down? Or someone else’s into which I have somehow infiltrated myself?’Guy Roland, or so his false papers claim him to be, seeks out his own identity in a maze of leads that illuminate the tragic tales of others and sends him further seeking traces of his own ghost. .I had the unpleasant sensation that I was dreaming. I had already lived my life and was just a ghost hovering in the tepid air of a Saturday evening.Why try to renew which had been broken and look for paths that have been blocked off long ago?.Attempts at finding someone who may recognize him or know him, spurred on by the hopes that it is in fact himself in an old photograph given to himself by his first lead, seem thwarted as the old generation is dying off. But with each story he hears, he finds a glimmer of hope in a small thread that continues his search, and with each new lead comes another story that paints a portrait of 1940’s France in mosaic form. These are identities tossed on the waves of history. ‘The sand holds the traces of our footsteps but a few moments,’ Guy’s former employer tells him, and Guy finds himself like just another ghost, another washed out footstep, remembering a time now gone, where even the restaurants have changed names and the past fades and yellows like an old photograph. There is always some thread to the past to be found if one looks hard enough. ‘Something continues to vibrate after they have gone, fading waves, but which can still be picked up if one listens carefully.’ These echos of the past are the only thing to seek refuge and understanding it. And nothing echoes more loudly than the boom of war, the fear and fearsomeness of identity checkpoints under occupation. In all his searching, it is to this sad period of history that all his leads point, the big bang of impetus sending all his contacts scattering across the globe, and in this aspect of identity being masked or misconstrued in order to survive is where Modiano’s musings are most poignant. While the longings for the Paris of one’s past are examined in much more depths and heart in Modiano’s Suspended Sentences: Three Novellas, the subtleties and elegance found here is exquisite.Missing Person is a rather straightforward novel, driven mostly by plot and dialogue that embody the spirit of film-noir at its finest. Modiano does well by having each lead seem more of a disappointment and distraction while giving subtle hints where to look next, however many of the connections seem a bit contrived in hindsight and the reader must have the good faith to suspend some disbelief in order to navigate the maze of mystery. It is when Modiano pulls back from the plot and digresses into philosophical issues or poetic impressions of his Paris wanderings that Missing Person truly shines. Though the plot-driven narrative is exciting and engaging—particularly the twist on the detective story found here—one can only wish the digressions and flourishes of prose that slow things down and allow the reader to really glimpse the heart of Paris and humanity were more frequent.'Do not our lives dissolve into the evening...'Modiano has recently been dubbed as a ‘modern Proust.’ While evidence towards such a lofty claim is glimpsed in small doses here, Missing Person seems too plot-driven and contrived to really suite such a claim. Suspended Sentences does better and seems a better portrayal of the key elements that earned him the Nobel Award. Modiano does excel at noir, and Missing Person breathes a wonderfully cold and weightless atmosphere of shadowy figures appearing and disappearing in both a literal mist and one of memory. Full of mystery, suspense and historical importance, Missing Person is a fun noir adventure but leaves the reader wishing the plot were more often pushed aside to let Modiano’s brilliant digressions grow wild.3.5/5‘I am nothing. Nothing but a pale shape, silhouetted that evening against the cafe terrace, waiting for the rain to stop.’
297`4`“Fino a questo momento, tutto mi è parso molto caotico, spezzettato…Brandelli, briciole di qualcosa mi affioravano d’improvviso, alla memoria, procedendo nelle ricerche…Ma dopotutto, una vita può ben essere questo… Ma si tratta della mia vita o di quella di un altro nella quale mi sono insinuato? ..”Ho scelto questa frase perché mi sembra riassuma il senso del romanzo di Modiano: i ricordi del passato, sbrindellati come stracci sfilacciati, niente altro che episodi sporadici fatti di nomi, di colori e rumori vengono assemblati dal protagonista del libro, un detective che ha perso la memoria, finchè, alla fine, assumono le sembianze di una esistenza. Nella postfazione Giorgio Montefoschi scrive che Via delle Botteghe Oscure è un romanzo proustiano. Secondo me si può dirlo se ci si sofferma al ruolo centrale che svolgono la memoria ed il ricordo in Modiano; tuttavia le affinità, a mio parere, finiscono qua. Per Proust la memoria è strumento con il quale liberarsi dalle catene del tempo ed arrivare all’essenza delle cose. Per Modiano la memoria è strumento per creare una esistenza dal nulla, senza però arrivare a nulla: non vi sono sentimenti, emozioni o sensazioni che risuscitano, ci sono soltanto spezzoni, immagini in dissolvenza e sfocate, persone e cose che di spalle, nella foschia, scompaiono in silenzio. Via delle Botteghe Oscure può definirsi come una summa delle tematiche trattate da Modiano nei suoi scritti, è piacevole da leggere,con una scrittura snella e semplice, complessivamente un buon romanzo. Tuttavia non riesco ad instaurare un feeling con Modiano, per cui penso di chiudere qui con i suoi romanzi.
298`4`“I was afraid I would not remember all these details. I should have been noting them down on the spot.” ~ Guy RolandThis complex novel had me also wishing I was keeping notes. It winds down many a foggy side street with many a shadowy character as amnesiac “Guy Roland” attempts to piece together his missing past: “I am nothing. Nothing but a pale shape . . .” He only knows that for the past eight years he has worked as a private detective in Paris with Constantin von Hutte, a man who not only provides him with an assumed identity and passport after learning of his amnesia but offers him a job in his agency. When Hutte retires and moves to Nice, leaving Guy without a formal job but with access to all the agency’s directories and files, Guy decides to embark on his last case - an earnest search for his own identity. The tension slowly builds as Guy uncovers clue after clue, many leading to dead ends as far as his birth name, but each leading to someone or something that propels his “memory” forward. There were moments in this novel when I wanted to grab Guy and say “Don’t do this - leave well enough alone!” but Guy is determined to track down every lead, no matter where it takes him. The ending leaves the reader wondering to what lengths we would go to retrieve our memories. Are we really “nothing” without them? Our past history certainly shapes who we are but does knowing it serve any other purpose than to supply us with memories? And just how “real” are our memories anyway? An excellent, thought-provoking literary detective/mystery story by Nobel Prize-winning author Patrick Modiano that ends with far more questions than it answers. My first by this author, but I’ll soon be tracking down another.“Scraps, shreds have come to light as a result of my searches... But then that is perhaps what a life amounts to...” ~ Guy Roland
