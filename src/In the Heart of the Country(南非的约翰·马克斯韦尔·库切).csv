1`2`**spoilers** I thought this was just going to be a book about a bitter woman thinking bitter thoughts out in the country... but early on, she commits a violent and deranged act of revolt that is really surprising and refreshing. Unfortunately the book doesn't have anywhere to go after a promising start when she axe murders her husband. So it just kind of stalls, repeats itself, and tailspins into sheer mad inner dialogue, which this author sucks at. So this book...sucks.
2`2`2.5 stars.
3`3`3.5 stars. The cleverly written story told in the first-person. Magda, the daughter of South African sheep farmer on a remote farm, has grown up alone with her brutal father and the servants. Magda is an unreliable narrator and it is hard to work out what actually is fact and what is Magda's imagination or delusion. Her age is not given but I guess she is probably in her 20s. The writing style is very clever and concise. A hard read but if you are a J.M.Coetzee fan, quite an engaging, satisfying read.
4`5`A beautifully written, but definitely depressing story.
5`3`A difficult to understand, but characteristically disturbing book by Coetzee. The violence and rage bleeds from the page.
6`5`A disturbingly beautiful book. This book read like a series of poems painting the grim picture of the life of a woman in Africa; filled by madness, poverty, longing, lust, and crime. I loved this book and I cannot wait to read more of Coetzee.
7`5`A genuinely harrowing, horrific, and unforgettable early work from Coetzee, hinting at a weirder direction he might have gone in -- his later works are certainly bleak, but none that I've read are quite so feverishly strange. A hard character and setting to forget.
8`5`A gorgeously-written, creepy book that I often think of, for some reason, as "Jane Eyre" in Africa. Short but searing.
9`4`A little bit dark and depressing but so much fascinating.The writing is vivid.To me it felt like a continuous journey from reality to fantasy.The novel is narrated from the point of view of Magda, the white daughter of a widowed farmer a, who is living at the beginning of the twentieth century on a South African farm . Magda’s father is the callous ruler of the farm. His character and the isolation of farm life in South Africa have a decided effect on Magda’s psychology. When her father takes a black mistress, Magda loses the line between reality and fantasy. Quite a complex book and sometimes confusing yet interesting.
10`2`A mad narrator is tricky at the best of times. This is not one of those. Bleak. D.
11`4`A riveting read, but so sad.
12`5`A spinster lives with her father and a few black servants in the isolation of a farm in South Africa. She is dutiful with her harsh father (her mother is dead), but she has a hidden rage against him, the farm, and her isolation both from the outside world and from the people she sees every day. The story is told in the first person from the point of view of the daughter. She is not a reliable narrator, and her stories are confused and sometimes taken back later. The story of her father remarrying early in the book is apparently not true. But the brutality of life on the farm comes through clearly, as do the power relationships: white dominates black; male dominates female. The territory is otherwise lawless.In the Heart of the Country is a grim, violent book, but a true one, in spite of the fact that the unhinged narrator can't be trusted.
13`2`A strange book. Disturbing. Difficult to penetrate. The narrator is untrustworthy and not someone we are rooting for. She is an awful person.
14`4`A tough read that's tough to review (and tough to like). Like Charlotte Perkins Gilman's "The Yellow Wallpaper," it's the story of one woman's madness, told by one of the most unreliable narrators in all literature. Isolated and ignored, she's trapped in the middle of nowhere, somewhere in Africa, with no real role in the world, so she has or imagines various violent and sexual interactions with her father, her father's slave/servant, and the slave/servant's two wives. Or maybe she imagines it all, to make her boring life less boring.On one hand, it's reminiscent of the sort of overly introspective, self-absorbed narrators of Notes from Underground or The Idiot who drive themselves mad over-analyzing everything about their lives and interactions with others. On the other hand, it's got the hopeless angst of The Bell Jar (when those with limited lives overlook the even more agonizingly limited lives of others) or some of Toni Morrison's bleaker moments. Coetzee's another of those fortunate writers who, it is obvious, has the talent to do just about anything he wants with literature. Here, he chooses primarily to mess with your head to make a point about a very messy world.
15`null`A vile topic made more so by artistic linguistics, as if writing prowess grants permission to soil the reader's mind and soul.No thank you.
16`3`An early work, a litany of 266 paragraphs, that has little of the depth of his later work.
17`4`And so my undergraduate thesis begins!
18`3`Anyone familiar with J.M Coetzee's writing will understand that he places a considerable demand on his readers. "In the Heart of the Country" is no exception to this rule. In fact, I would go so far as to say that this novel is one of his more opaque. Most of his novels have in one way or another embodied a form of subjective experimentation. The subject of this one is the colonial farm woman. If you are a reader who enjoys the security of a well developed plot and coherent narrative, then this is most definitely not the novel for you. Coetzee attempts in this novel to recreate the consciousness and experience of the marginalised from the perspective of the most maginalised character imaginable - Magda, the daughter of a disillusioned farmer struggling to maintain his farmholding.Coetzee deserves praise for the sheer ambition of his novel. Placing himself in the shoes, into the very mind of Magda, is of itself a daring feet, which I can't help but feel he pulls off. Behind every doubt, every prejudice, and every insecurity (of which there are many) voiced in this novel, one hears the echoes of long tradition of South African farm writing. Olive Schriener, Doris Lessing and in particular the short stories of Pauline Smith are influences from which J.M Coetzee has drawn heavily in order to more accurately represent the plight of Magda. Utterly isolated from the norms of civilisation or the support of a family, Magda's consciousness is fraught with the confrontation of the unknown. Her story is the story of thousands who have come before her. It is the story of the utterly powerless, and subjugated; the story of those whose voices are drown out, and too often forgotten. Magda's story, for all its incomprehensibility, points constantly to the notion that above all her confusion she is as essentially human as anyone else. Her intense, often joyful, connection to the landscape around her, together with her aching to find some connection, some piece of recognition from someone, anyone, shames the reader into not judging her too harshly. The suppressed violence and sexuality of her imaginings are clear indication of her human desire, which is replaced by her remarkable capacity to forgive, and understand, the acts of violence and prejudice committed against her. It is arguable that Magada, pushed to the limits of desperation, manages to, transcend her own prejudices. It is this idea that redeems her in light of all her confessions. A persistent reader should hope to find themselves lost in, and empathetic towards, Magda's being. It is in the hope of finding some meaning to her confusion, some understanding of her twisted thoughts - a recognition of Magda as a suffering, creative, and perhaps even visionary individual - that the reader is richly rewarded by overcoming their own prejudice. An issue present at the very heart of South Africa's literary, and literal, history. Expect more than a few hours light distraction before picking up this book. 
19`1`Appalling stuff.Lacks the lyrical majesty of his works and took longer than any book I've read this year to complete; despite being a short novella.The degredation oppressors are willing to put upon themselves is an interesting development, but it takes so long for anything to happen I couldn't have cared less by the time it arrived.
20`5`As strange as it is brilliant, the madness of political oppression turned inward and domestic.
21`3`Beautiful imagery, metaphor on top of metaphor. A haunting story and a gift of a read.
22`4`Books like this make me realize that I'm far too trusting of unreliable narrators. Why did I believe what she was saying? A great book; hidden in the interpersonal relationships in this small country farm, are revealed the gender and racial dynamics of South African life.
23`4`Classic Coetzee. The first half was a bit slow, but he builds up a character that plunges into a kind of madness with such brilliance.
24`4`Classic brilliance of Coetzee, tackling complex questions of the human condition with simple tales and language. Highly recommended
25`4`Classic, deep, rough story. It is a classic but take a deep breath before starting.
26`5`Coetzee has created a strange and miserable character, who is both believable (somehow) and yet symbolic. What a weird story! I loved it.
27`1`Coetzee is amazing. But I could only get halfway through this book. I couldn't get a grasp on the plot at all. Oh well, there was bound to be something of his that I didn't like eventually.
28`5`Coetzee was my tutor and lecturer at UCT in the 70s, so I was keen to read and analyze his writing.This is his 2nd novel and with WFB and Age of Iron, my favorite. It is so stark and intense, poetic and mytho-poetic. Heavily influenced by Barthes and Lacan's theories, it explodes the South African tradition of the farm novel (plaasroman) and exposes the raw heart of patriarchy.
29`5`Covers similar ground to Disgrace, but while Disgrace is polished and clear, Heart is more obscure. Coetzee explores the unreliable narrator and paragraphs are numbered as though marked in a diary where usual timestamps are not obeyed. Violent and unsettling throughout.
30`4`Definitely brilliant (although to call Coetzee brilliant seems cliched). I didn't give it 5 stars because it's just too disturbing. But it deserves 5 stars; it's haunting. Really.
31`2`Depressing, hopeless, well-written so will stay with me for quite a while unfortunately. Not my bag.
32`4`Disturbing and incestuous, but very good if you like that kind of stuff.
33`5`Do white spinsters dream of dust at dusk?If yes, does their lust 4 a last kiss at leastprevent the rust from eating their breasts?A "must" for goodreaders...
34`3`Double take. The suppression and creation and imagination of a life-story, of a self-narrative is the protagonist here. Magda lives through (possibly/probably/definitely), imagines, and reimagines how Hendrick rapes her. Magda imagines and enacts and disregards killing her father when he takes a new lover. When one sees oneself outside of society, as ugly, as unwanted, as barely human, as vulnerable to all - when one's imagination is informed by those prompts, how much can we trust the 'master narrative', even when we want to sympathize or castigate? These questions are the basis on which the dust of the novel's words blow across.
35`4`Essentially 4.5 but Goodreads doesn't offer that like Letterboxd. Far more piercing on the soul/the eternal present versus the fantasy of being historicised and embedded in the past than any other Coetzee novel much more disturbing and complex.
36`3`Everyone occasionally misses the mark, right? That's the feeling I had after reading Coetzee's "In the Heart of the Country." This was the 8th book of his that I read and my least favorite. On the surface, Coetzee is in his comfort zone here. He's writing a story that grapples with apartheid, race relations, and existential dread. On the surface, this book has shades of "Disgrace" and also shades of "Life & Times of Michael K," but doesn't quite come together in the same way that these weightier books do. My sense is that this is in large part due to the length of In the Heart of the Country. It's a slim book (coming in around 130 pages) and felt more like a short story. As a reader, I never felt connected to the protagonist, a lonely middle-aged woman named Magda--who suffers in Coetzee-esque fashion. Part of this might be because we've seen this same story before, but with better execution in the latter books. Part of this might be because the book is written like a series of diary entries, each told through the sometimes incoherent ramblings of a lonely, middle aged woman in Apartheid S. Africa. As a reader, I appreciated Coetzee's attempt to break away from the straightforward narrative here, but the reading wasn't pleasant and the narrative was hard to follow at times. I'm not literary person, but I wonder if this was supposed to reflect the mental life of Magda, a character whose mental health deteriorates across the book. In the end, I really wanted to love this book, but it didn't live up to my high expectations for Coetzee. That's OK, though. I once read that Kurt Vonnegut only rated three or four of his books as "great." Even the greats occasionally have missteps. 
37`3`Extremely dark book! And when I 'm saying dark i really mean dark. Don't get this wrong. Dark books can be great and it's not a bad feature for a book. It is all written in the first person in a kind of diary form where a woman called Magda is making some confessions for her life. Coetzee is diving really deep in human soul and his work is totally characterized by it's innerness. His language is beautiful and he's talking about loneliness, the human need to love and be loved. Also he underlines the relationship of master and slave, white and black people, man and woman. And all these in the very heart of a country (South Africa) where you feel sometimes that even God has forgotten it. It's one of the very first novels that he wrote, it's not really easy and comfortable for an average reader that seeks something light as a reading. The only sure is through it you can easily understand that this man has more to offer us literally and you should read him again. Overall I liked a lot this book, it's the second one I have read by Coetzee after "Disgrace" which was in my opinion one level higher than this. (Actual rating 3.5 stars, means something more than a just good read).
38`4`Faulkner and Dostoevsky in South AfricaIntriguing, bold, staggering, revolting, horrible... these are some of the emotions I experienced, while reading this short book. The young spinster Magda is the daughter of a sturdy but brutal farmer in a dark corner of South-Africa. Magda yearns for love and attention, especially that of her father. She gives us a very distorted view on reality, in endless repetitions and variations, not only very close to insanity but even far beyond. This book is a true writing-experiment in the best of modernist tradition (it reminded me of Becket and of Faulkner). But it is also a relentless and gruesome exploration of the human psyche and human condition. Coetzee is a worthy successor of Dostoevsky. Through the eyes and terrible acts of Magda we are confronted with the question of good and evil, but from a postmodernist perspective. And Coetzee's reflections upon the master-slave-relation (Magda and her father versus the black servant Jakob) give this book a real South-African flavour. In my opinion this is one of the best and most interesting books of the last quarter of the 20th Century.
39`5`Faulkneresque, and, like Waiting for the Barbarians, a bit heavy-handed with the Deep Allegorical Meanings, but wow.
40`3`Fierce, bleak.. beautiful. It's a short read, but I read it in snippets, like poetry. Madness is exhausting."From one of the farthest oubliettes of memory I extract a faint grey image, the image of a faint grey frail gentle loving mother huddled on the floor, one such as any girl in my position would be likely to make up for herself. (p. 2)""Words are coin. Words alienate. Language is no medium for desire. Desire is rapture, not exchange. It is only by alienating the desired that language masters it... The frenzy of desire in the medium of words yields the mania of the catalogue. I struggle with the proverbs of hell." (32)"The shouting still hangs in the air, like heat, like smoke. If I want to I can reach up and wave my hand in its thickness." (58)"The beauty of the world I live in takes my breath away. Similarly, one reads, the scales fall off the eyes of condemned men as they walk to the gallows or the block, and in a moment of great purity, keening with regret that they must die, they yet give thanks for having lived. Perhaps I should change my allegiance from sun to moon." (60) "How can I be deluded when I think so clearly?" (126)
41`3`Filled with isolation and dejection, Magda living in a farm is slowly but surely becoming raving mad. This is a 150 page account of her rant as she deciphers, questions and justifies all that she is doing or is happening to her. An unreliable narrator, Magda changes the story several times and you know you cannot trust her. The book hauntingly brings out the emotion of isolation, giving no hope.
42`2`First Coetzee book I’ve read that I didn’t much care for.
43`1`For a 139-page novella this was a hell of a slog. I’ve always found Coetzee, for a Nobel Prize winner and a man very clearly smarter than the rest of us, to be a surprisingly accessible writer: his prose is crisp, clear and concise. In The Heart of the Country, his second novel, this is unfortunately not so. It tales place on an isolated farmstead on the South African veldt, the narrator a young woman whose father is having an affair with the wife of his black farmhand. The novel’s style has a dreamy, unreal aspect to it, often bordering on stream of consciousness, and it can be difficult to tell what’s real and what’s a daydream or a fantasy. I hugely admire Coetzee as a writer, but as I said, this one was a slog.
44`3`Haha, I can't believe how much Coetzee I've read over the years. A splintered narrative of horror and disassociated female identity - the literary depiction of stifling is remarkable.
45`4`Harsh but excellent. The first Coetzee I read.
46`4`Haunting! This is my first Coetzee read and I'm intrigued. I've never read a male author who writes from a female perspective so well. The circular, muddled, disorienting stream of conscious narrative from Magda isn't meant to be completely understood. Once I realized this and stopped trying to tie myself to a concrete plot I had an easier time reading.Great read! Can't wait to compare it to his other works.
47`2`He's not my favorite, J. M. Coetzee. I know very little about South Africa, and for some reason, Coetzee throws me for a loop. I cannot figure out if he is nostalgic for the old Apartheid days, or if he's making fun of it. It makes me uncomfortable, whatever it is, and not in a good way. Anyway, this book I thought was an improvement on his other books I've read, to begin with. It got a bit long-winded and cyclical towards the end. It was a chore to read, even when it's so short. I like unreliable narrators, but this one didn't feel like she was genuinely twisted, just a bored person making up different versions of the same events. I'm not sure why it bothered me, but it did. It might just be my unwillingness to read Coetzee. If that makes it an unfair review, so be it.
48`3`Hmm. Lush prose. No real good guys. Tragic.
49`3`Horrifying and provocative. This narrator is not to be trusted. Coetzee paints a meticulous portrait of a lonely farmgirl, though I don't think he is ultimately able to embody the female perspective--Magda's thoughts don't always feel genuine. However, I don't think it was Coetzee's goal to become Woman--this, really, is a portrait of South African farm life and the racial issues so deeply embedded there. A heavyhearted read.
50`5`How can you commet on Coetzee? Everything he wries is extraordinary. This is no exception. Brutal, hits you in the guts with some of the most amazing images created in the modern novel, i'd say. Check out the scene when the aeroplane flies over head. Until that moment, I thought the book was set in the C19th. And of course, that was Coetzee's point. If you want to know about South Africa, read this book.
51`1`I can't believe that this was a winner of the nobel prize for literature. I randomly chose this book from the library in order to broaden my horizons. It was 150 pages of rambling. It was too overly descriptive and despite being a short novella took ages to get through. It is written from the prospective of the main character Magda but due to the fact that she is unstable (in the story) all the descriptions are quite repetitive and you never know what is meant to be real or if it is just a figment of Magda's imagination. If you're interested in reading that kind of a story- Go for it. 
52`3`I can't say that I enjoyed this book from a story point of view - I like to know what is happening. However, it is a brilliant book, written with a sure command of the language and a depth of feeling rarely found in fiction. I'm going to pass this on to a writer friend of mine.
53`3`I couldn't say that I totally understood this. I think so much is happening, well at least in the main characters head, that I need someone to discuss this with. I'm not even sure if everything I read happened (although I think that is what I was supposed to be thinking about). It was confusing, but then hey, so is life. I felt in someways, it covered many issues and themes that I have read in some of his other novels, but the format of the book and allowing it to be told from the perspective of an untrustworthy protagonist is a risky move. 
54`3`I didn't like it !! like at alla very very depressing story !!
55`4`I didn't review this one at the time but it's certainly stuck with me since. Having recently tackled a lot of McCarthy I've found myself coming back to Coetzee's desolate veld as a comparison to McCarthy's bleak landscapes. In another life I'd love to do a thesis on the textual violence in these two authors' environments. Coetzee presents such a sparse style here, really all interiority as far as narrative, giving the environment, by contrast, more ominous weight. Of course brutality has often been explored in terms of externalities - the elements, raw landscapes, forces of nature - so it's quite a feat to give so much space to an interior monologue, especially through the muddied voice of fantasy, in exploring malice and cruelty. It's not always clear where our narrator is in her own narrative, whether we are being asked to understand something that really happened or whether we are abetting a deceit. And of course the whole thing is fiction so does it matter anyway? Coetzee's great skill here and in much of his work is that he goes beyond the unreliable narrator and makes the text itself problematic (something he gets into more deeply in Foe). Definitely one of his strongest works, but also one of the most enjoyable to read.
56`4`I don't know: it was a little slow off the ground, but it eventually got to me in a big way. Second half is the best.
57`3`I found it tough going.
58`4`I found this novel very, very hard to follow with all the time-and-universe-hopping that is the core of the narration. I didn't realize until the very end that Coetzee intended to express the disorientation of Magda herself. (As I write this I happen to understand many of the puzzling questions of the book. It's all about her need to feel. Doesn't matter if in the real world or in an oniric one).
59`2`I guess there's only so much incoherent ramblings I can take.
60`5`I had heard about the idea, and then read a few, but it's likely nothing will ever exemplify 'unreliable narrator' better than this novel. The writing is brilliant and convinced me to read more of this Nobel Prize winning author.The mind of his main character belongs to a seriously unstable woman who is alone in a harsh and bleak landscape, even when perhaps she isn't. It is filled with brutal yet surely fantastic events and the people that may or may not exist in the 'real' world of the novel she is situated in, seem equally disturbed. As the reader is lead deeper and deeper into this troubled mind and land, I couldn't help seeing the parallel between Coetzee's, In the Heart of the Country, and that of another great narrative, also set in Africa, Conrad's Heart of Darkness. They are indeed a matched pair. There is no better way to describe what is encountered there than 'The horror! The horror!'
61`2`I had to read this for a course on colonial literature and literature about colonialism. Although I do understand why people may find this captivating and beautiful, it was not my cup of tea. I think Coetzee's prose is to reminiscent of poetry and I prefer a more straightforward style of writing. However, I did find the plot to be very captivating and thrilling until a certain moment. Although I was very interested in reading what was about to happen next, I was too distracted by the writing style and this got into the way of understanding the plot. 
62`5`I have no hesitation in giving this 5 out 5. The piece is reminiscent of Lessing's 'The grass is singing' just far more distressing. Coetzee is a master.
63`4`I loved the suspicion and fear Magda harbors along with the wickedness of the African kid. The rape scene was really.. Intense. The story is really rustic and earthy.
64`4`I loved the writing style, but I'm still not sure I understood the book. I think it deserves a reread.
65`5`I loved this book. Coetzee seems to pose this question throughout the novel: What is real, what is reality? What is real may remain forever unknown, but what is certain is the disorientation and alienation that Magda experiences as a result of her life with her father on an isolated farm in South Africa. Sitting with nothing but her own thoughts for hours or days, longing for human connection and conversation she eventually loses her touch with reality. I can't help but fell sorry for her.. I kept thinking, if I lived Magda's fife, would I become like her too? After all, it is a thin line between loneliness and insanity..
66`1`I read this and several other books in an "Intro to World Novels" class during my undergrad years. Of all the books on the required reading list, this was the one I disliked the most.
67`5`I read this book in one single sitting. It took me 5 hours, bloodshot eyes and a splitting headache, and I'd do it all over again just to experience the emotional torpedo it is. Coetzee's work is bedazzling. His command of language - razor sharp, Lycra tight; the sheer muscle force of his imagery, and the tight, vide-like grip he holds over every word on a page is the stuff of masters. This book is startling.
68`null`I read this novel for a PhD seminar titled “Intersubjectivity and Theory.” I have read Foe before, so I wasn’t entirely a newcomer, but that novel didn’t prepare me for this experience, so I decided to leave my review for after the class discussion. I am after now, but I’m not sure I’m more capable of writing anything interesting about it.Anyways. The narrator of the novel is Magda, an old maid daughter of a sheep farmer in South Africa, who tells stories of her life on the veldt with her father, their servant, Hendrick, and later Hendrick’s wife, Anna. Quite early into the novel the reader realises that these are, indeed, just stories: we cannot decide with any certainty what has actually happened and what is just the fiction of Magda’s mind, or to whom certain things have happened. This uncertainty is not resolved even at the end of the novel, which, of course, leaves room for all sorts of interpretations, but it also leaves me a very confused and frustrated reader. (For example, we can’t figure out for sure whether Magda has any siblings, because she doesn’t know either – and that is but the smallest of confusing details.)The most important topic for me was, I guess, the way Magda was desperately trying to break out her role previously given to her by society and also break down the prescribed rules of communication, but with very little success. (It’s nearly impossible not to give anything away, so let’s remain this vague and abstract.) If you are into Hegelian philosophy, you might find that storyline interesting − or if you’re into Western philosophy in general, as Magda is extremely well read, and her musings often evoke philosophers and literary works, and it’s definitely interesting navigating her web of intertextuality. But as fascinating as that can be on an intellectual level, personally I still cannot like this novel – or Coetzee’s sparse style in general.
69`2`I really did not like or understand much of this book.
70`1`I really didn't like this one. I think I don't like any book with a theme about insects.
71`2`I really wanted to like this, this author is considered a real up-and-comer, but I have to admit, it was so dark, Kafka-esque disturbing and a little confusing, so maybe I should try one of his others
72`2`I suspect that this book might be quite important as a feminist text but strangely written by a man. However I didn't feel it worked for me because the narrator just did not convince me. She appears to be a highly intelligent well-educated person with awareness of feminist philosophy as well as linguistics, but her life is a mess and she is incapable of coping with her situation. She seems to have no idea about where money comes from. It just doesn't ring true to me. Also there are some pretty horrible descriptions of bodily functions and it is deeply depressing. Too 'deep' for me.
73`5`I thought this was brilliant writing. It is such a dark and depressing story in many ways but it is illuminated by an intelligent survey of the terrain and the possibilities for survival in the face of adversity.Magda is such an intriguing character. I feel I know her and her anger and other passions that she is trapped in. The dry and arid land around her sucks the life out of her but it is really her own inner turmoil that is her worst enemy. Like many in South Africa, I suppose, she needs to work out how she is going to adapt to the new realities since democracy.
74`3`I waver between giving this book a 3 or 4 star review. I like what I have read of Coetzee's work - his economy of language builds the most vivid of human portraits. In The Heart of The Country lacked that economy and spent lengthy passages exploring the labyrinth of Magda's imagination, often delving into a complexity that left me more frustrated than enriched. It is a woeful story - no surprises from Coetzee there - and one that truly enraptures in parts. But only in parts.
75`2`I'm not surprised that Coetzee used to teach linguistics. I hate to use this cliché but he's got a way with words. Unfortunately they were wasted on a plot that can be summarized as the monologue of an aging old white bitch, single and angry about it. The prose was good, but this was not really "fun" to read. I will definitely be reading his other work and hope it's more exciting.
76`4`If Rosa Coldfield had (god forbid) an even more fraught relationship with Thomas Sutpen and wrote a diary in her delirium, this is the book she would write. A novel in the subjunctive, it is difficult to know what does and does not happen here. The book is in the form of Magda's diary, consisting of numbered paragraphs. They tell the story of a South African daughter's relationship with her father, the farm and a pair of black servants who work there. Magda is small and ugly and ignored. She fantasizes about her father bringing home a new wife. Then, in what is apparently not fantasy, she relates how black farm hand Hendrik brings home a ripe young wife. Her father corrupts the pair, taking the young girl for himself. Magda cannot abide this and shoots him in the stomach, a wound from which he slowly dies. The increasingly delirious prose details the fallout from this event, Magda eventually ending up alone on the decaying farm, a mad figure regarded as a witch or worse by her neighbors. The hallucinatory prose uses the elements of Magda's situation (many of which the reader cannot rely on since Magda is the quintessentially unreliable narrator, unsaying many things she says and narrating events three and four times in different ways in succession, as if trying to get to the heart of the matter through language) to meditate on identity and language. Indeed, the grisly, sad tale itself seems to exist solely for the purpose of allowing Coetzee to descant on these topics. Magda sounds like no ill-educated, abandoned and ignored young Afrikaans woman but a philosopher of language—something she herself comments on at times. It doesn't seem to matter. The tale and Coetzee's meditations on selfhood and words are interesting enough to surmount these barriers to verisimilitude.
77`4`If you ever wanted to give an example of an unreliable narrator, Magda from In The Heart of the Country would be it. This is a novel intended to challenge, provoke and confuse. Magda is a white woman (sometimes young, sometimes old) living on a very rural farm in South Africa, the daughter of a hard and emotionally enclosed (potentially abusive) man. As the novel moves along, Magda’s repetition of certain themes/concepts are the only aspects we know with some certainty: her bitterness towards a neglectful father, her jealousy of any woman he spends time with, her attraction to Hendrick, her very low self-image, and her growing insanity. Everything else is uncertain. There are three (possibly more) instances of Magda’s father dying, references to sex that are both assault and consensual, and flashbacks that we aren’t sure are memories or wishes. Yet, it’s clear Magda is suffering. She is an intelligent woman denied a purpose and a chance to self-actualize, an existential crisis that spirals into derangement. The novel also deals heavily with colonialism and race, reminding me of Doris Lessing’s The Grass is Singing. Magda, despite her race and position in the household, consistently refers to herself as a slave, conflating her situation with the servants. Is she justified in doing so? Yes and no. While she comes from a place of privilege, it’s clear she is socially constricted. She spends so much of the book focusing on her failure to be what society expects a woman to be – a “good” wife, a mother – and on how she feels she has failed in life because she hasn’t “given herself over” to be a wife to some man who will make excessive sexual demands of her. She correlates sex with power and is confused when other women show sexual desire. She has desire for one of the servants, which also confuses her, as she is not supposed to see him as anything but hired help. In truth, I felt sorry for her. As much as her perspective grated on me (and at times I wanted to shake her), I understood the social climate in which she was trapped. She claims she has “freedom” (in that she lives off the grid without anyone to gaze upon her), but it’s clear she does not. If her relationship with Hendrik even happened, it is parallel to what she suffered under her father – she considers abuse to be affection and is confused by her unhappiness within it. This is not a “fun” read, but an exercise. I’m glad I read it, but I’ll likely never again. Some nice lines though: "I am corrupted to the bone with the beauty of this forsaken world." 
78`3`If you like a flowing plot and want to avoid confusion, this book may not be for you. Although the writing is often beautiful, the multiple retellings leave one in doubt of what is happening, as the narrator is clearly mentally disturbed and very angry, unable to really know when she is in the real world of fantasy. There are many dark insights into life on an isolated South African farm, with commentary on the patriarchal system, master-servant relationships, and the mentally disturbed. I can see why so many admire his writing. Not really a fun book, however.
79`4`If you like depressing and dark fiction about colonial South Africa, then read this. If you like quasi-experimental/poetic prose, then also read this. If you are not keen on either, then find something else. This novel is tense, and never ceases in its tautness.
80`3`In the Heart of the Country follows the story of Magda who lives a solitary life on a farm in South Africa. The main thread of the story revolves around Magda's father who shames Magda by taking the servants wife to his bed. What follows is Magda tending to the body of her father and the deterioration of her already lonely life. The book explores issues of race, lust and deals with Magda's apparent descent into madness.There is little wonder that Coetzee has won a Nobel Prize for Literature, the prose and narrative in the book are incredible and there are some sections that take your breathe away.There is no doubt that this is a stunning piece of literature but my only criticism would be that at times I found it hard going. I think my favorite aspect of the book was that even when it came to an end you couldn't be sure that what Magda has described has really happened. Was it or wasn't it all in her mind? 
81`4`In the Heart of the Country is a staggeringly goddamn powerful novel. An espresso: short and dark and intense. And it'll keep you awake once you've finished it.I can't fault the quality of the writing. (Of course I can't: Coetzee is a brilliant writer.) But I would say: this is not his most ambitious novel. Why? Because it's all couched in the first person — in the (extreme, vibrant, crackling) voice of a character who is deeply troubled, mentally unstable. This has been done before (albeit not in this context, imbued with the racial tensions of colonial South Africa). And, as voices go, it is perhaps *slightly* easy. Because it is so extreme.Subtlety is harder. Normality — mundane, humdrum normality — is harder. And what I *really* admire (and what Coetzee gives us, incidentally, in a novel like Disgrace) is literature that illuminates — and I really mean *illuminates*: literature that sets a halo around the stuff of everyday humanity. Without ever having to resort to extreme subject matter.Because a great artist can make beauty and drama out of the most humble constituent parts.That said, Coetzee inhabits his narrator's hysterical voice with outstanding skill. He is very convincing indeed.Which means that this is an horrific novel — in its bleakness, its darkness. Sad, harrowing, terrifying.
82`2`It is such a hard book to get into, I didn't really enjoy it until I was in page 80-ish. Still, I felt like I couldn't be sure of what I was reading, so it didn't have much of a point to it. The last few pages make a good point on the nature of the whole book, so it did have a good closure. It was quite an experience, but not one I'd like to relive soon.
83`4`It took me a while to settle into the rhythm of this novel, but after I did I was hooked. The consistent first-person narrative absorbs you in Magda's head, while the author never allows you to return to normality/rationality through other point of views. Magda's mad voice started to make more sense (I don't know if that should make me question my own sanity). She became worthy of my pity, while simultaneously remaining absolutely repulsive. There was something very human about her madness; a deep-rooted desire for company, communication, confirmation about who she is as a woman. I don't think her madness was innately part of her, but rather a product of her environment. She condemns language because it's a language marked by master-servant dynamics, while all she longs for is to converse on equal levels. This idea is however rejected by both her father and the servants, who are neither capable of acting on a level outside the colonial power system. Loneliness, unfulfilled desires and boredom drive her crazy. It brilliantly shows how the structures of colonial opression affect both parties. 
84`5`J. M. Coetzee burst onto the literary scene in 1974, with his novella Dusklands. That work, which told two unconnected stories: the first was about a US government agency worker, Eugene Dawn, losing grip on reality due to the psychological toll of his work – he has been responsible for deaths in the Vietnam War – and stabbing his son. The second, and to me more interesting one, told the narrative of Jacobus Coetzee, and his interactions and conflicts with Namaqua tribe in eighteenth century South Africa. Both pieces, however, revealed a preoccupation with lives lived on the periphery, where psychological instability becomes a norm. Coetzee’s second novel, In the Heart of the Country, published in 1976, continues this preoccupation. Magda is a young white woman who lives on an isolated farmstead with her father, and their two servants, Hendrik and Anna. The novel, a solipsistic narrative, probes the depths of Magda’s unravelling psychology with insight, depth, and a language of rich poetry. Despite it’s brevity, the Vintage edition I read clocked in at just 151 pages, In the Heart of the Country contains so much it feels a novel twice its length. It is a difficult novel to discuss without spoiling much of what makes it so powerful – so let us just say that there is a tragedy and that the consequences of it causes the three remaining lives to free-fall. The relationship between master and slave is tested, and ultimately broken, as personal, physical and sexual boundaries are crossed, or shattered in with brutal force. The natural world, which has impinged upon the sanctuary, consumes them all, and Magda is left howling at the desert wind, lost and alone. This is a novel in which every word seems carefully considered and placed. There is not a wasted word. It is precise, razor sharp in its execution. Its heady atmosphere completely overwhelms you; it is a novel that threatens to destroy you. For a second novel this is very good indeed, and further proof, is it were needed, that J.M. Coetzee was one of the most interesting novelist in the western world. He still is.
85`3`J.M. Coetzee amazes me. However, that fact doesn't seem to be conducive to any sort of jovial existence. So, for the sake of my psychological well-being, I had to force myself to abandon In The Heart of The Country — despite my initial impression that this, like many other Coetzee works, is a work of genius. The narrative voice of this novel, in my estimation, is as memorable and as effecting (and as wonderfully psychotic) as some of the greatest narrators I've had the pleasure of experiencing. Humbert Humbert and Charles Kinbote come to mind immediately. The writing is dark, visceral, dense and laser-focused—it's difficult for me to put into words. The experience of reading this book is as close as I've come to staring directly into the face of the infinite darkness and meaningless of human existence. Because of this, I couldn't really cope and had to finally end my suffering about 75% of the way through. If readers' only other experience with Coetzee is his novel Disgrace, and are looking to find out if he has written lighter and more accessible works (which, considering Disgrace's themes and content, isn't asking much), you have come to the wrong place. Back away slowly and then, when you deem it safe, turn around and run away as swiftly as you can. If you maybe thought that Coetzee might have begun writing with lighter themes in mind and then, once he had gotten the hang of what he wanted to say and how he wanted to say it, subsequently moved towards darker and more substantive subject matter, you would be mistaken: this book (along with Dusklands) is Coetzee establishing THE LIMITS of his bleak, existential worldview. If you have the psychological fortitude for boundless gloom, I would recommend this book without hesitation; it is, without a doubt, brilliant. Conversely, if you are the type of person who would categorize yourself as anything else than the aforementioned champion of doom and gloom —actively seeking out books that combine shockingly graphic murder, disturbing or forbidden (for good reason) sexual urges, wet and painful shits and various things of this nature — then I would recommend avoiding this particular entry from Coetzee.Five stars for the writing, one star for my resulting depression.
86`3`J.M. Coetzee can really write some powerful stuff! "In the Heart of the Country" explores the relations between "master" and "servant", set in the vast desert somewhere in South Africa, at an indeterminant time. Written from the POV of Magda, the daughter of a powerful rancher, this story evokes a lot of emotions. The characters are all very real, if a bit strange, and Coetzee's prose is both beautiful and disturbing at the same time. I didn't care for the ending at all, and not a great deal for the story itself, but the writing was pretty great. I rated this one 3 1/2 stars down to 3*.
87`3`J.M. Coetzee’s novella “In the Heart of the Country” (the US edition, for some obscure business reasons, is titled "From the Heart of the Country") is quite an unusual literary work. It is composed of 266 numbered paragraphs, some of which contain just a few words while others comprise two pages. Mr. Coetzee's writing is not as mathematically precise and economical as in six other books of his that I have read so far. The sentences in this novella are still wonderfully economical and precise, but their sequences are not. The paragraphs flow in a convoluted and hypnotic way; they circle the subject, touch it, and again float away. I do not care much about plots in literature, but some readers may be put off by not knowing whether the events that ostensibly happen in the plot are real or just fabricated by the narrator.The story is narrated by Magda, a lonely spinster, by her own admission an ugly, old, dried-up virgin, who lives on her father's sheep ranch, in the middle of nowhere, deep in the heart of the country, "where space radiates out of [her] to all the four corners of the earth." Nothing has happened in her life so far. Her mother died a long time ago. Her father dislikes her for not being his son. The only other people on the farm are the "brown-skinned" servants. In her life she has had more contact with insects than with people. Her own thoughts are her only companion, and she is a keen, if a bit hysterical, observer of her thoughts. Her father may have brought himself a young new wife. Or maybe it was his servant, Hendrik, who brought the young woman for himself, and the father sleeps with her. Magda kills her father. Or does she? Quite bizarre events follow, culminating in Magda's memorable conversations in Spanish (which she does not know) with the flying machines.Many reviewers find various issues and metaphors in the novella: the master-slave relationship, the colonizer vs. the colonized, the racial conflict, etc. I disagree. To me, the novella is a grand exercise in writing. The author sets out to describe how reality is perceived and distorted by an aging, embittered, and extremely lonely woman, who is slowly losing her sanity. Mr. Coetzee spectacularly succeeds in all aspects of the endeavor. Magda's "stream of consciousness" is completely believable (even if the events may not be realistic). I very rarely agree with blurbs on book covers (they are almost always exaggerated and misleading), yet this time one quote is absolutely correct: "The writing and mood are a remarkable piece of sustained intensity ... One false word could have ruined this short tour de force completely. It never does." With its virtuoso writing, the novella is indeed a literary tour de force, a masterpiece of form and style. Yet, I do not find much depth in the book. The fascinating structure is empty inside. The beauty of the novella is superficial. This is not a masterpiece like "Disgrace", "Boyhood", or "Waiting for the Barbarians." Even the most unforgettable passages are more form than substance.This is also one of the most demanding books I have ever read. I have spent over 12 hours to read its 151 pages. With books by lesser authors, the same number of pages would take me an hour and a half.Three and a half stars.
88`5`JM Coetzee has a way of making you marvel at words.I could not help pausing throughout this novel to show empathy for the protoganist.The story line roared with emotion about this young spinster in the far away land of South Africa , living on a farm with her father, who ignores her, treats her like she is invisible and by his actions , strips away any esteem she has of herself.This is a raging mad woman who stops at nothing to let the reader know her feelings.
89`5`JMC spins a deeply-fucked tale of being a really really shitty daughter that reads with all the fat of a skeleton's ribcage. O how I love thee, delightful human terror.
90`4`Just finished reading "In the Heart of the Country" by JM Coetzee. It is a bleak and desolate tale of a daughter's loneliness in a stone desert in rural Africa. It did make for difficult reading.
91`3`Like reading a poet's nightmare.
92`null`Lots of topics in a very small book, written in numbered paragraphs--darkness, mental health, possible incest, oppression, colonialism, and yet, interestingly written.
93`3`Love him, but probably my least fav
94`null`Loved it. Could have been very self-indulgent, but the length of the novel prevents that. Use of language was beautiful, and his ability to expose the bones of narrative is very impressive.
95`4`Macabre, disturbing book; not what I'd call an enjoyable book. Consistently dark from page one till the end and as The Telegraph put it, "not one false word in the book". This isn't meant for reading every now and then, rather, read it in one go and you'll get a sense of Coetzee's skill with literature.
96`3`Magda is a white spinster who loves to keep her thoughts to herself. This whole book is all about what's going on in her mind as she is a self-absorbed, self-centered, unfriendly and thinks of herself as a victim of the people around her. So, instead of speaking to her father and their family's servants, she just keeps her thoughts to herself.When her father seduces Anna the wife of their farmhand Hendrik, Magda resents it and the narration becomes more confusing as if it mirrors her mind. When her father dies, Magda sees it as a way to freedom. However, she does not have money to run the farm and the household, so Hendrik takes her as his mistress. This is a difficult read because if you don't slow down, you will not know what's being said and what's going on. Magda is definitely an unreliable narrator and you just can help marvel on how Coetzee, this being just his second novel, was able to second guess the mind of an intelligent yet a bit crazy woman. This is my 5th book read by him and he definitely does not rewrite himself. Although most, if not all, of his books are set in South Africa, they speak to me maybe because I am also from a third-world country and Philippines was also colonized by Spain, US and Japan for many years.And oh, the prose. The prose is scintillating and I can not help wonder how Coetzee was able to put all those beautiful and meaningful phrases and seemed to just go on and on.Overall, I liked this book. Thin plot. Metaphor is obvious: Magda is the colonized African country and his father represents the native people who embraced the colonizers. Hendrik is the colonizer and the races are reversed just to put a nice spin on the usual race-colonizer roles.
97`4`Magda is crazy hell! But her rambling rant is so riveting!
98`3`Magda is the only daughter of a widowed sheep farmer in South Africa. She is largely ignored by everyone and, as such, sees herself as withered away before she ever really got a chance to live. The book is her running commentary on her life, her thoughts and her fantasies. Often, it's difficult to tell reality from fantasy- for instance, her father dies a few times in the book, but in the end, she's still talking about taking care of him. The depth of feeling is palpable. You can feel Magda's desperate loneliness, her immense desire for companionship and love, but her absolute ignorance of how to achieve it. She has been relegated solely as an observer of life and can't bring herself to actually live. Food: a bitter, lonely drink in the corner of a dusty, forgotten bar. You go looking for commiseration but only find desolation. 
99`5`Man, this book just killed me (loved it though). It's about a girl/young woman who grows up on an isolated farm in South Africa with her cold, unloving father and some servants. She is the narrator, and the sections written go between fantasy and reality, where sometimes you're not sure if what she describes is real or not. What is real is her self-hatred, lack of self-esteem, and total absence of any will to make her life better than the primitive, emotionally cold life she has been given. Not going to spoil the juicy details, but she ends up alone on the farm, basically slowly dying of starvation and losing her sanity. Folks who like sad, dark stories with no redemptive quality in the protagonist will love this book!
100`2`Most of this book I didn't understand, and what I did understand disturbed me.
101`5`My favorite of Coetzee's; I think it's his most concentrated effort. He buries into this protaganist deepest thus creating his most genuine, well-rounded character no matter how strange her circumstances. Even though she lives on the very outskirts of "civilization", its outer boundaries, inside of her resides the heart, soul of her country, and so she's not so marginal as she might seem. An effective parable, and I believe Coetzee is most effective in the first-person narrative.
102`4`My favourite aspect of the book has to be the brilliant portrayal of impact of language, rather, impact of its fluidity. Almost entirely like an internal monologue of Magda, effect of language and its fluidity on her inevitably affects the readers too.
103`3`My fourth novel by Coetzee, and I still don't particularly care for his writing. At least his books are fairly short.
104`5`Not a casual read. This book uses a character to examine the deepest places of the human soul. The ending remains mystery and it's really up to the interpretation of the reader to make their own conclusion. You'll get out of it as much as you put into it. This author really has a unique voice.
105`3`Not nearly as good as some of his others - some great passages but also some utter dross.
106`4`On a remote, arid, farm, a father alienates his daughter when he takes the servants wife into his bed. Magda, the narrator, is a some what crazy unreliable narrator. What's again, this author has the black African helper rape the white woman who owns the house.It was unusual to have the same circumstance described a few different ways so you didn't really know what exactly happened or what the narrator just imagined.
107`5`One of his three best, along with Disgrace, and Waiting for the Barbarians. Not for the faint hearted.
108`5`Only 139 pp but w/ dense and convoluted sentences acting as speed-bumps the entire way. Dark, difficult. If Olive Shreiner and Faulkner had a baby, and also the baby was insane, this is the book it would write
109`2`Overall, disappointing. Having loved 'Disgrace' for its sparse story-telling, this felt too self-indulgent. It's a first person, diary-like account of a woman living in the middle of the South African veld at some point in the 19th century. Her world is a bullying father, monosyllabic servants, and the harsh landscape around her, and she goes quietly – and at points not so quietly – mad. It’s only 150 pages, but the writing felt stodgy because nothing happens for long periods, and our narrator is perennially isolated. It’s a very genuine attempt to convey the experience of certain women in colonial South Africa, but it took me ages to get through because the tone is so self-reflexive. That, of course, is the point, but it didn’t make it an easy read. 
110`1`Ponderous without being profound and absurdist without being funny, this slim novella was a chore to read.
111`2`Quit this one, too. Sort of liked the Robert Cooverish narration style of having to figure out fact from fiction but just didn't feel any relationship with the characters.
112`1`Read this after hearing review's of the author's critically acclaimed "Disgrace" and was incredibly disappointed. It's the story of the daughter of a slave owner and her relationship with one of the slaves (subverting racial roles etc.) The short book was incredibly dense. Lessons learned, an award-winning author is not necessarily a sure bet.
113`5`Really Powerful stuff... I think all Coetzee's stuff is pretty incredible - just lyrical and transportive. Beware though - they can carry you off towards the cliffs of insanity.
114`4`Review to follow. I'm currently camping for the week. Very little cellular signal here.I think what I enjoyed best about this book -- though at first it troubled me -- is the confusion between thought and reality. If I were to write an essay on this, my topic would be the contrast between reality and the narrator's telling of it. I think it would expose how her desires and worries surface, and I wonder whether I could make any conclusions about her thoughts and feelings. The telling of the story does remind me of some Faulkner.This is quite a bleak story. The language, though, is delicately balanced. I really enjoyed the individual pieces more than the overall story. That feels strange to say.
115`4`Sad and desolate and tough, but a really excellent book to read. It's not easy going but if you stay with it, it has rich rewards. I couldn't believe how it kep me going late at night, trying to understand the nuances and the lovely detail that is always there in the background. Really good writing but, as I say, you have to work as a reader.
116`5`Set in a barren part of South Africa and narrated by a spinster daughter, this tense tale will keep readers in suspense the entire book. The 5 stars are for the writing and conception of such a character, and the intelligence apparent throughout. It wasn't an easy read because the main character has mental issues, but it was powerful. The story is a study on extreme loneliness and isolation, devoid of love, touch, and caring, cut off from discourse with other people. The father in this story appears cold towards the daughter, at least from her perspective. It's hard to tell what reality is, and Magda, the daughter, plays out various scenarios in her mind. She's intelligent and introspective, reasonably well read, and yet knows little about normal life outside of the few people in her life and the vast land on which she lives. The book is a fascinating psychological essay. Brilliant, probably beyond my understanding. This slim volume is utterly unforgettable. The author has won two Booker Prizes and the Nobel Prize for Literature. I'd recommend the book to people who like literary works.  
117`4`Some incredible moments of prose. Not my favorite, but still absolutely mesmerizing.
118`2`Still cannot figure it out, but I love it~!Magda is endearingly crazy.
119`3`The Heart of the Country written by J.M. Coetzee, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2003, is 151 pages of nuts. I picked up this title from the 1001 Books to Read Before I Die list but, be warned, while memorable, this is not a pleasant read.Magda, a spinster daughter, living with her father on an isolated farm "outside of the law" in colonial South Africa, plunges us into her world of loneliness, yearnings, and delusions. The writing is dense and vivid. A lot is crammed into the thin volume of Magda's conversation within her own mind. Very quickly, we realized that something is not quite right with Magda. Her rendition of events are not reliable. She would narrate the details of an event but become discontent with her own narration and change her tale. She considers herself the author of her own life and as with authors, she narrates the events of her life as if it was a work of fiction, revised over and over searching for a rendition she can be content with. This leaves the reader unable to distinguish the events as it really happened versus the events as it happened in her imagination or under her own delusions. I am both impressed with horrified by this book. The writing is absolutely amazing. J.M. Coetzee is a master of words and has managed to paint a deep psychological impact of colonialism, gender roles in a patriarchal society, oppression, isolation and loneliness into a single individual in so few pages. I wish there are different categories of ratings for a book on Goodreads. I would give this book 5 stars for the writing and 2 stars for likability. Would I pick up the book again? Probably not. Magda's mind is not for casual reading.
120`5`The South African writer J. M. Coetzee has often chose his native land as the setting for a study of power plays, and his 1977 novel In the Heart of the Country is one. The unnamed narrator of the book is the spinster daughter of a white farmer in the Karoo. This narrator is already angry at finding no purpose in life beyond serving her father, but her father’s sudden involvement with another woman pushes her over into murderous rage. The narrator, Magda, gives us her thoughts not in a conventional narrative, but rather in 266 numbered paragraphs, where what happens between the paragraphs is sometimes as important as what is directly mentioned. Furthermore, our narrator is an unreliable one, and the reader is led to question the veracity of her desperate statements.Magda’s account is rather comparable to Samuel Beckett’s novels: a narrator rambles on and on, because silence would mean death. The thoughts and actions of this narrator, no matter how commonplace, are described in extreme detail, which draws out the absurdity of our everyday existence. Unlike Beckett, however, Magda inhabits a country where different races coexist in relationships that are strictly governed and fraught with conflict – though in spite of the prescribed roles, the subtle intermixture of black, white, and coloured in the Karoo has always happened nonetheless. Coetzee invites the reader to consider who has the upper hand in this tense interplay between farmer and farmhands, and how arbitrary those historical circumstances are. Furthermore, Magda is a woman, and women on the farm were expected to follow a set of conventions of their own.I have read quite a few novels by Coetzee, and I find that while his work is profound, his way of writing is generally a straightforward and uncomplicated one, and some books of his I’ve even finished in one sitting. This, however, is considerably more complex than his other novels. The narrator’s prose is so rich, so bursting with similes and metaphors, that it feels like one reading isn’t enough to really take it all in. I soon felt that In the Heart of the Country is a novel that has to be read at least a second time. It is also the most viscerally corporeal of Coetzee’s work, with the narrator describing the workings of her and her father's body -- warts in all -- in some of the most graphic tones. However, the ending of this book, where the narration turns inward towards Romantic longing, seems quite similar in spite to that his acclaimed novel Disgrace of two decades later.I found this an enjoyable novel and am really looking forward to reading it a second time soon. However, I do think that this would be a baffling introduction to Coetzee, and should be left to readers who already consider themselves a fan of the writer. Furthermore, some familiarity with white-owned farms in rural South Africa seems necessary, as while some Coetzee books have a universally accessible message in spite of their particular setting, this one feels particularly rooted in South Africa.
121`4`The book reminded me of Faulkner and took and equal amount of concentration and mental energy. It takes a bit to get into the rhythm of the writing. The main character/narrator’s grasp on reality is tenuous and she frequently re tells events changing what happens in each re telling. Some things seem to be entirely made up, though the truthfulness of the events is irrelevant to the story.The main characters reflections are some of the most powerful parts of the book and give an insight on power and its impact on personal relationships. Ultimately, sad.
122`4`The first part is remarkable. Unfortunately it decreases interest by the end of the story.
123`2`The first-person narrator of this book is Magda, the daughter of an Afrikaner sheep farmer on a remote ranch in the South African veldt. Magda has grown up alone with her stern, patriarchal father and the servants. She is a bitter old maid, ignored and disregarded. By page ten, you figure out that Magda is kind of nuts. Somewhere along the way, you figure out that between one paragraph and another, sometimes within the same paragraph, Magda slips between fantasy and reality without warning. By the end of the book, she has completely lost her mind and you have to reevaluate everything you've read because it's not clear what really happened and what was Magda's imagination, fabrication, or delusion.The story centers around Magda and her father and Hendrick, a black African servant who comes to work on the farm, and his wife Anna, whom Magda's father, living alone and wifeless out on the veldt, soon covets. Obviously this isn't going to end well, especially with Magda watching, judging, and resenting. The violence seems to be the point where Magda goes off the rails into complete unreliability. She tells multiple separate and conflicting stories over the course of the book, with no textual clue to the reader that they are not all part of one seamless narrative.The imagery is stark and isolating as Magda and the handful of other characters scratch out a living in the scorpion and jackal-haunted boonies, but what's really stark and isolating is the relationship between the white farmer and daughter and the black servants, initially friendly and benevolent on the surface, but their every interaction is fraught with the weight of colonialism. The power dynamic between oppressor and oppressed switches several times over the course of the novel, which I think was probably Coetzee's intent. It is indeed a bleak and powerful tale.That said, this is a book for readers who like literary prose, meaning sentences and paragraphs worked and reworked to artistic effect rather than to tell a story. Magda's internal monologue, even when it's not spinning off into crazy la-la land, is incessantly navel-gazing, dense, and verbose. In the Heart of the Country is one of those books where sometimes you have to reread a paragraph several times to figure out what is actually being said and what's going on. You would think a novel with as much sex and violence as this one packed into its sparse few pages would be more, well, interesting, but it's only interesting on the level of verbiage and literary analysis. It's the kind of book literature professors like to talk about and ask midterm questions like "Describe some of the metaphors the author uses for colonial and patriarchal relationships," blah bah blah.Honestly, I don't understand people who read books like this for "fun." Literary, prize-winning prose is often not exciting, storytelling prose, and in this case it's almost like simple declarative sentences and a linear narrative are verboten. Yes, I understand the story, yes, I saw the hidden depths in Coetzee's book and I'm sure I could write a term paper about it as well as the next English major (even though I was never an English major), but boy did did it drag and unlike some other literary authors (like Cormac McCarthy and Haruki Murakami) who sometimes annoy me but also tell a story even when they are experimenting, and intrigue me enough to want to read more, Coetzee makes me want to stay away from anything else he's written because this book did not endear him to me.That sounds like a pretty negative review, and if I were rating this based on my enjoyment of the book alone, In the Heart of the Country would probably get 1.5 or 2 stars. But I can't help but admire an author who puts words together in a way that most can't and manages to drag such powerful weight and layered meaning into such a small book. So I am bumping it up to 2.5 stars based on "literary merit," but rounding down because I still thought it was self-important dudeliness. I can't say I recommend it unless you are reading it for a specific purpose, though, or you just really like this kind of book.
124`3`The language is stunning but it seems wasted because the plot and themes are very obscure and dense. A short book, true, but a very difficult and tortured path. Heavy! on its symbolism.
125`5`The protagonist of J. M. Coetzee's In The Heart of the Country is a woman, one of such furious intelligence that she can hardly abide herself or anything else on the remote farm where she has always lived. She exists in quiet, careful measure, and the violence wrung from her, as it is from the land, makes for a kind of song, an extraordinary lamentation.Recommended by Gin, Powells.com
126`3`The second of only two books I have read from Coetzee. The following link leads to my review on my bloghttp://freduagyeman.blogspot.com/2009...Thanks
127`4`The strangest and perhaps most disturbing Coetzee novel I have read so far. The novel's setting is a strange indeterminate version of South Africa in which historical time and biographical time are frequently conflated, its plot a series of frequently violent or inexplicable events of which we are unsure which are real, which fantasies of the narrator, Magda, its characters similarly defined and redefined by the perceptions of Magda. Scenes are often repeated several times in a row in different versions, as if being rewritten on the fly by their dissatisfied narrator. The novel ends with as ambivalent an ending as any of Coetzee's work. A boldly strange and intense book.
128`4`The third sentence of From the Heart of the Country begins “Or perhaps...”—it establishes our narrator as unreliable from the jump, although it’s impossible to understand at that point just how unreliable she will prove to be, and just how tenuous is her grasp, and ours by extension, on her narrative. The novel is comprised of 265 segments, which often begin with a fragment, as if the narrator is trying to figure out, or create, the context of something around her; many rewind scenes and play differently, as if she is reinterpreting things on the go, or remembering more clearly (or perhaps altering her memory).This sense of construction on the fly befits a book that is deeply concerned with the minimum constructs of civilization, and the minimum constructs of language, and how the two depend on each other. Magda’s deeply aware of her life as both a construct and a narrative; her voice skews pleasantly close to that of her author when she actively and openly intellectualizes, as when, for example, she discusses the potential of something to “carry me from the mundane of being into the doubleness of signification” or she notes, clinically, in the mode of a novelist, that “Character is fate.”The occasional use of choppy, repetitive sentences in From the Heart of the Country (especially in the early going) shows Beckett’s linguistic influence on Coetzee more strongly than I’ve seen before in his fiction (save perhaps the moment when John Coetzee paraphrases Lucky’s monologue from Waiting for Godot when asked to tell a story in Summertime). But Coetzee is working mostly in a mode that reminds me more of the Faulkner of The Sound and the Fury (and achieves a similarly ensorcelling effect), a blend of abstraction and precision that conveys mood through representational expressionism, as when Coetzee describes a scene as “brown on grey on black, the space discomposing and recomposing before my eyes,” a beautiful sequence that shows Coetzee adding his own twist of a level of intermediate awareness of the relation of this sense of dissociation in the latter part.Dissociation is key to the effect of From the Heart of the Country. The numbers of the entries are completely unsynchronized with any conception of time (Magda at one point refers to being “[b]orn into a vacuum in time,” and the entries seem more closely mapped to space, if anything—Magda describes her efforts as “numbering the universe steadily with my words”), and entries are sometimes separated by apparently huge chunks of time, and sometimes seem not like separate or distinct entries at all but questions asked of the previous ones, or further elaborations on an established scene, or additions of details or other possibilities. Action is sometimes separated into a different entry from dialogue, and one or both of which may be contradicted or challenged by later entries. There often seems to be increased dissociation between form and content with more traumatic episodes (which find a single event splintered across multiple entries, as if the time reflected is the time it takes to process trauma) and otherwise emotional ones (which find the narrator sinking into analysis as if not to dwell on her emotions; when least emotional. Discovering and probing these sorts of patterns would be a particular pleasure of a revisit.It perhaps makes sense that From the Heart of the Country, as the story of a woman whose diary represents her effort to elevate her story from the mundane to the mythic by mere virtue of being written, takes some time to get going, nearly half the book before it approaches its final plateau, though it doesn’t lack interest before that point, especially in terms of the prose. While at first Magda depends on her imagination, and later her machinations, to catalyze the plot, eventually things develop an inertia beyond her control, though by then it’s less than she has come to need, and less than we, guided by her more rampant imagination, have come to expect.The tensions between the imagined and reality are essential to this novel—“Lyric is my medium, not chronicle,” reports Magda—which is, concerned with bodies and signification (“What is Hendrik at this moment, a man plagued by ennui sucking a grass-halm or a patch of white against green?” reads one of Magda’s kōan-like inquiries) and the dichotomy between body and essence, combining a great sense of the physical with a fantastical array of parallel visions of suicidal reveries and fratricidal fantasias. Despite her strong imagination, Magda makes sure that her imaginations of alternate timelines all eventually end curdled. Though the curdling may be appealing to her too, or if not appealing, simply inevitable, her idea of destiny or fate that all things end there. And perhaps it’s not the curdling of fantasies so much as the acceptance of reality, the final and single reduction of infinite possibilities, a bitter endpoint for a woman whose diary—whose life—is so centered around the value of imagination, storytelling, language, fiction, literature.
129`5`There are two types of novels by J. M. Coetzee: the historical & the metaphysical.The metaphysical ones include Summertime, Foe... The best of these is Elizabeth Costello. Historical: Life and Times of Michael K, Waiting for the Barbarians, Slow Man, Disgrace...And the best of these is THIS novel.His unending obsession with the insufficiency/stupidity of words and language as well as the story's reliance on its components of beginning/middle/end finally strikes the reader as meaningful and ever-appropriate. Sharing many themes with his most successful work, Disgrace, this one absolutely chills the blood with its tense moments of violence, rape & murder.
130`4`There is no doubt that Coetzee writes masterfully. Beautiful, yet grotesque. Mundane, yet profound. There is also no doubt that Coetzee is not afraid to tackle difficult subject matter - uncomfortable topics that leave the reader rattled to the core with existential conundrums that do not seem to have satisfactory solutions. What choice does the reader have but to shift uncomfortably in their seats, swallowing the bittersweet taste of privilege? This book probably deserves more stars because it is so well crafted. However, in order to allow for varying levels with which to distinguish the books I read (lest I end up with everything being an unhelpful 5 stars), I have decided to give ratings based not only on craft, but also enjoyability. Thus, this book, whilst being engrossing, did not engage me with the protagonist, who was unattractive to the core of her being. Indeed, amongst the small cast of characters, there was barely a single one who was able to rouse the reader's endearment. Add to this a confusing jump between the protagonist's dark flights of fantasy whereby chapters were played out, only to be re-written in the following chapters, leaving the reader confused as to what has actually happened. Even when the reader learns to relent, learns to give up fighting these conflicting realities and simply be carried along the various paths the story takes them, there is an unsatisfying, unsettling inability to understand what is happening. That is when the reader begins to realise that the story itself is a reflection of a bigger picture. The various versions of the same story thread become the voices of not just one protagonist, but an entire gender, an entire generation after generation, living the same miserable lives, repeating the same horrific crimes that have been woven into the fabric of a embittered, embattled society. One of the resounding themes in this novel is that of masters and slaves. One of the echoing thoughts that haunts the reader afterwards is the question of who in the end really is enslaved and who or what is the jailer.
131`3`This book FUCKED WITH MY HEAD. I mean, as a reader I'm usually the metaphorical pervert in the corner waiting for something seedy to happen but this, THIS was even beyond my voyeristic interests.  Even though Magda is clearly past her prime I couldn't help but see her as a child, a really fucked up child, but a child nonetheless. So when she has that opening fantasy where she's hanging out in front of her dad's door naked I felt like a pedophile. She's completely helpless but she's amazingly self aware. As a character she's all at once crazy and very accutely aware that she's not normal, which is a bit jarring. She's almost like a two headed snake because she has this totally crazy and completely helpless side but she also has this raving mad, i'm gonna shove my dad in a grave so the flies will get the fuck out side. Coetzee seems to be repeatedly suggesting that it's Magda's lack of sex that makes her crazy (as exhibited by her using chicken fat as lube... What.The.Fuck.), and I suppose the fact that her only experience with sex by the end is repeated rape doesn't help to set her mind straight at all. I feel like I'm not doing it justice because by the time she started burrying her father I tried not to dig too deep into her psyche for fear of throwing up all over the pages. But I still wanted to know EVERYTHING. Because I'm a sick, sad little lady. I swear though, if she ended up raping that little kid as an old woman at the end I would have thrown the book in the trash... too bold Coetzee, too bold. I had the most grotesque image of a wiley eyed old lady doing the insert penis in vagina fingers and it MIGHT have scarred me for life. I'm still unsure how I feel about any of the characters, but maybe that's what Coetzee is trying to get at. The big question is are they truly evil or are they victim of circumstance? I think that's an overwhelming question in a setting like South Africa where you have these racial divides and these social stigmas that they can't help but try to keep. But then you get into the undertones and how there are moments where Magda will say one thing but mean another and Hendrik will respond to the former with his words but the latter with his smile, etc. So did she shoot her father because she felt she was correcting an evil act he committed by sleeping with Anna? Did she shoot him because she's simply bat shit crazy? Is daddy a hard ass because he has to be or is he just kind of a dick? Did Hendrik help her burry the master because he still felt bound to serve or simply because he hoped to get paid? Or was it because he was pissed that someone else was banging his wifey? And was Anna sleeping with the master because she really had no choice or is she just a dirty little slut? Coetzee makes her out to be such a timid little child but I feel like these questions are open for interpretation with each character. The whole book was just, ugly. Coetzee did an amazing job showing distaste for just about everything. There's a scene where she puts on pink slippers and his description of them made me think, "ew, she nasty." But I love that because there is nothing likeable about anyone or anything in this book. The people are all shitty and if not shitty then there's still nothing to like about them (I know I question whether or not they're evil but that's a big step away from shitty... I think).  I think that this was a really interesting follow up to The Body Artist because it was almost a total contrast. You don't really get to know the characters in the body artist and you don't really care to (but you want to care... you just can't), but you get to know Magda SO well through her self awareness and personally, I could have done with less. It's also a really interesting contrast to the style of narrative used in each because I think Chris was right, the incomplete sentences and the jumbled nonsensical thoughts coming from The Body Artist were very accurate to the way we think, but it still made it hard to read. This was so complete and overly self aware that I found myself thinking "there's no way she's got all of this happening in her head like this" but I found out so much more.  I also wanted to mention how ridiculously cool Coetzee's use of repetition is in this book. It's one of the ways that he fully acknowledges Magda's insanity. We learn about an event for the first time and that account is immediately discredited by a 2nd and 3rd version of the same story. No event is given more credit than the next and we are left to decide which version is the truest, if any are true at all. The last book I read by Coetzee (aptly titled "Disgrace") was just as miserable, but there's something about the way he writes, somehow draws me in and all at once disgusts and intrigues me. I think that poetic is a pretty accurate description, which is also why I think it feels so exhausting to read. At times it's not just that she's crazy, it's that Coetzee writes in such an abstract or unnatural way that you really have to work to figure out what the fuck he's talking about. But somehow I want to know more about this filthy farm in South Africa where people shoot their dads and speak shitty Spanish. That's where I think Coetzee comes out on top. He succeeds in making the reader WANT to know about such ugly people in such an ugly place where there is no hope, only blood, fire, flies and probably some really shitty coffee. All in all I gave it a 3, I feel like Coetzee almost wants you to hate the book because he wants you to hate South Africa in that setting and all of the shit that happens there. Besides that, the whole not knowing exactly how to feel about the characters kinda made me not sure about how I should feel about the book as a whole.  One thing is for sure, that Coetzee thoroughly succeeded in grossing me the fuck out.The lines: "But who would give me a baby, who would not turn to ice at the spectacle of my bony frame on the wedding couch, the coat of fur up to my navel, the acrid cavities of my armpits, the line of black moustache, the eyes, watchful, defensive, of a woman who has never lost possession of herself?" - Ya right, I'd totally hit it. "This monologue of the self is a maze of words out of which I shall not find a way until someone else gives me a lead. I roll my eyeballs, I pucker my lips, I stretch my ears, but the face in the mirror is my face and will go on being mine even if i hold it in the fire till it drips. No matter with what frenzy I live the business of death or wallow in blood and soapsuds, no matter what wolf howls i hurl into the night, my acts, played out within the macabre theatre of myself, remain mere behaviour. I offend no one, for there is no one to offend but the servants and the dead." - This simply blew my mind.  "It cannot be otherwise, if i am simply sucking this history out of my thumb how am i to explain those three wooden benches stacked at the far end of the room, and the easel behind them on which Jakob used to hang his coat?" - I feel like this is one of her rare moments of sanity, where she's questioning how she sees things and so she grips onto something mundane to regain some concept of reality. "Here in the middle of nowhere i can expand to infinity just as i can shrivel to the size of an ant. Many things I lack, but freedom is not one of them." - Again, so good.
132`5`This book blew me away, i talked about it some here: http://5cense.com/12/lalibela.htm
133`4`This book felt more like an enemy the further I got.Four stars for the craft, dear mr. Coetzee.
134`5`This book provides sources to think both about colonial South Africa and the nature of human being, especially its darker aspects, that we're often afraid of investigating but at the same time are part of each of us.
135`4`This book was a weird toss-up between a 4 and a 5 star read. The writing itself warranted a 5 star. This was my first Coetzee book and his talent cannot be denied. Each sentence was so intricate and full of euphemisms. I think I may just be a sucker for that kind of beautiful language but it really blew me away. However, the reading of the book was not actually enjoyable so I bumped it down to 4 stars. People who read these reviews to get a sense of the book they are about to read should know that this is a dark, depressing story that has no happy ending. Also it is not an easy read either. Some of the scenes are graphic, but it is the actual style of the story that makes it seem really long and dragged out. There were several times that I was reading and thought, "Wow, I've only read 4 pages? So much has happened." A lot of these reviews say that Magda is unlikeable and unsympathetic. I do not know how that is possible to conclude. If anything, the sorrow I felt for her situation was unbearable. Her mental state is a direct result of her loneliness. A lot of her narrative and stream of consciousness states "I am I." as she ponders her existence. But I really question whether she would be "her" if her father showed her the love that she so desperately wanted. What Coetzee did with his characters was brilliant. The master/slave dichotomy in South Africa was portrayed so vividly, but then he broke down that dichotomy so that Magda felt like a prisoner in her own house. There are so many aspects of colonialism that are at work here and I'm sure any English major would have a field day with this book. Also another point that I want to comment on: the status of women in the story is appalling. I'm not what you would call a huge new wave feminist. But the horrible treatment of women that was described here really made me flinch. Is it really like that in places outside the United States? I feel lucky being given the opportunities that I have. I read somewhere that this is not a book to read for fun, but that is what I did. I'm glad I picked it up because it's rare to find such an accurate portrayal of sorrow in literature (not that I'm really looking for it... definitely need a happy read after this one). I'm very much looking forward to reading Coetzee's other works.

137`3`This book was dark. It is the diary of a woman living alone on a isolated ranch in S. Africa. I think she was retarded. She hates herself. She kills her father because he doesn't give her the all his time. At the time of the murder, her father was doing his servant's wife. The book talks a lot about how sex could be the salvation for loneliness. The book describes sex and violence well, and has many poetic and insightful verses.
138`1`This book was full of colorful descriptions and beautiful symbolism. Well, all that crap was lost on me. I randomly picked this book off of '1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die' in an effort to broaden my horizons and get away from the best seller list. Big mistake. Thank God this book was only 130 pages or I might not have been able to struggle through it. It was mostly narrative with very little dialogue or action. There were about 20 pages towards the end that were interesting because of the dialogue and the interaction of the characters, but most of the book was this chick's crazy thoughts in her head. I never quite understood wtf was going on. Her Dad was married, he wasn't, she killed them, then they were alive. My best guess is that she was crazy as a loon and was imagining this stuff in her head. I'm not really sure what was reality and what was just her rambling. Anyway, I'm sure someone more intellectual than myself would probably appreciate this novel much more than I did. After all, Coetzee is winning prizes for his work, so who am I to say that he sucks. Not for me, but if you are into literature and taking a few minutes to figure out what the heck you just read, check it out:) 
139`5`This is a book written by a spider, a spider who wants to tell you its story, a spider who wants to reveal itself in the empty spaces of its web, a spider who wants to keep certain secrets. This spider lives in a desert of stone, in the heart of the country where one's heart turns to stone, weaving with words, counting sentiments (120), "numbering the universe" (27), "giving life to a world" (10). This creature without possibilities is creating (and re-creating) a web of possibilities (past/present/future), showing us a life that aches to be, showing us literature in the process of coming to life.Which part of this dense world [1] shall I pick to write about? Loneliness, language, memory?Destiny, metamorphosis, family? Shame, desire, love? The fact that the meanings and mechanisms of life and literature are contained in a 140 page story about a spinster in the heart of the country? This "poetess of interiority" (35) has indeed written hymns about the heart despite her claim that it would have been "too easy" (139).[1] And make no mistake, this is Coetzee's Kafka-and-Quixote-inspired world. "And books are indeed world-models. St Augustine found that the best model he could find for our experience of past, present, and future was the recitation of a psalm." (Frank Kermode, The Sense of an Ending) If that's not a good description of the experience of reading this book (in fact I think a recitation of it would be quite powerful), I don't know what is.
140`4`This is a really strange, but powerful book. It is the story of a spinster living in a remote area of the South African veld. It is written in a stream of conscienceness style of very short segments. Some only one sentence in length. She floats from reality to dreaming to imagining. She also goes in and out of sanity. It is difficuly to determine what is real. I had a very difficult time getting into the book. But once I did, I really liked the book. I had to reread some paragraph several time to understand what was being said. The story is disturbing but thought provoking. I recommend this to someone who wants to read a "difficult" book. 
141`3`This is so hard to critique. The author shows signs of brilliance, but at the end of the day it is a difficult book to read, let alone understand or enjoy.
142`4`This is the second book I've read by Coetzee and both have impressed me...the writing is vivid, and real..the description full.....Our m as in character in this seems, to put it mildly,a little nuts....but it's not obvious from the beginning, because she sort of slips into a narrative that you only realize later isn't true when completely contradicted.Made up of a small set of characters, it feels claustrophobic, and slightly menacing, but very very readable.
143`5`This is the story of a woman named Magda living in physical and mental seclusion in South Africa, told through her memories and thought processes. From page one of this novel I was hooked. I couldn't stop myself from marking passages because Coetzee's writing is so vivid, intricate, and so alive with imagery. I love the way he renders the psychological pathways of Magda's thought, showing how her isolated mind turns inward on itself, how she invents and reshapes memory and experience with words. Magda is a fascinating narrator, the language of her fantasies is dark and disturbing as well as exquisite. She examines her existence as if she were a specimen under a microscope, an insect under a naturalist's eye, and her thoughts are alternately surreal and concrete, desperate and restrained. I'm just in awe of Coetzee's ability to craft each section of the narrative in such consistently beautiful language, like isolated poetic dreams connected by the slippery threads of Magda's psychosis. Drowning in loneliness and monotony, it's plausible that Magda's fiercely imaginative, under-stimulated mind sought beauty and meaning in fantastic and unsavory illustrations of her life. Magda is so clear at times, and always so self-aware, that it's almost convincing that she has lived a life less violent and disturbing as her fantasies lead us to believe, and "made herself up" to distinguish herself from the dust. Whether her memories and experiences are truth, fiction, or "the bridge between" as she says, she has left her mark in the memory of the reader through the bizarre beauty of her words.
144`3`This story is the epitome of an unreliable narrator. told from first person you quickly learn the main character only knows the day of the week because of her bathroom schedule. It may be a modern story with planes overhead or a story set ages ago and the narrator sees the planes just as she sees her other twisted fantasies.
145`2`This thin book was a challenge for me to finish. It is very well-written, but so very intense, and then nearing the end got stranger than I expected and than I thought necessary. It will probably be a long while before I try another book by this author.
146`1`This was a confusing book. It deals with heavy themes and the narrator is very unreliable. It's the the second book I read from the author and I think it's just not my style. But even though I didn't like the book I appreciate what the author is doing.
147`3`This was a pretty difficult read. Not only is the content extremely dark and painful, but the language itself is difficult and often confusing. I would have rated this lower, however, it was beautifully written.
148`5`This was my first Coetzee read. It's quite disturbing, and when I first started reading his other books, I was disappointed that they were not similarly disturbing. But  Disgrace is just as uncomfortable - it just doesn't read that way throughout since it's written from the point of view of somebody very much like the author.
149`null`This was my first taste of the Nobel Prize-winning author's work. I fear it will be my last. I loved Coetzee's prose, which is crafted to a brilliant and eccentric finish, and the story has mythic resonance and is grippingly told. Yet for all that I found it impossible to finish this book. Too much violence and misery inflicted upon characters I didn't like enough to really care about.If you liked East of Eden or the novels of E. Annie Proulx, you'll probably like this. And if you have literary good taste, you'll surely like it better than anything by Cowpoke Annie. But sooner you than I.
150`5`This was such an incredible book! I really can't delve into its intricate and stylistic story-telling choices without giving some major things away, but I also really can't recommend it enough! It was such a captivating read, and the diction and language usage was wonderfully fresh and full of pulp.
151`3`Three stars isn't really fair; but I'm deep enough into Coetzee's catalog to be rating this book compared to other works of his that I read. It's a sparse, chapterless story about a white-owned family farm in the middle of the African desert. The friendless Magda, the narrator, struggles to find where reality lies between her bare surroundings, her abusive father, and the new natives he hired that change everything. An alagory about the shaming effect of colonialism on all parties involved, it's far heavier than it's 150 pages indicate. "The innocent victim can only know evil in the form of suffering. That which is not felt by the criminal is his crime. That which is not felt by the innocent victim is his own innocence." Yikes.
152`3`Typically restrained, but interspersed with patches of melodrama. I've never read a book that made me squirm like this one did. But not his best.
153`4`Unrelenting but thought provoking.
154`3`Very dark and quite depressing, but a very interesting read as the narrator is borderline insane and you can see the world through her distorted sense of reality.
155`4`Very twisty and turny. I had a difficult time following what was real and what was not until the very, very end, which then made me reassess what had occurred much earlier. Well-written and engaging. #1001books #790left
156`5`Violence and revenge--real or imagined--on an isolated South African farm. One of those books narrated by a character so disturbed that you don't know what's real and what's fantasy.
157`5`WARNING: As nightmarish a vision as anything in world literature.
158`3`Way way too depressing. And confusing
159`2`We read this for my last DC book club meeting. Sad. I chose this book because I really liked "Disgrace," another book by Coetzee. However, this book proved to be a harder read than Disgrace, possibly because it was written from a madwoman's point of view. But once I got into the rhythm of her monologue, I became intrigued by her story and by trying to decipher true events from imagined ones. Extremely depressing book though.
160`null`Well okay. Couldnt put it down. Not sure how much I enjoyed it. Not sure about Coetzee writing the book through the eyes and life of the main character-a woman. Fundamentally it was about a woman who couldnt get laid (but who does eventually) living in the bush in South Africa who is madder than the maddest madman.....
161`3`Well, that was just the feel-good read of the year, wasn't it?Jesus.I don't often read books like this, and, even now, I can't even begin to describe what that category actually is. I remember reading Thomas Hardy's Jude The Obscure and fucking hating it. It was so filled with misery without the slightest attempt of hope or reason or a remote coming-and-going of happiness. It read like an endurance test. And I noticed some similarities between the general depressing tone of Jude The Obscure and In The Heart Of The Country. But J.M. Coetzee succeeded where Hardy failed by making the protagonist strangely engaging and sympathetic. I don't know how he did it, because...that bitch was straight-up nuts. However, I have to admit that I was generally intrigued by Magda.The narrative was very first-person, given that there wasn't much dialogue, and I find that that style usually ends up sounding like a long, long half-assed diary entry. It was way more tell than show and it only worked because of the poetry style of narration. If it had been a stream of consciousness of complaining, I would've considered taking vengeance on the novel. But, instead, it reads like a long, really good Emily Dickenson poem (and I never actually dug her work). It provided a stillness of life that I don't often observe or acknowledge. I can't imagine any of us raised in the city or the suburbs having the patience to live on that South African farm because there's so very little culture and entertainment. Seriously, she did nothing. All she had was her insanity. If she didn't have her insanity, she would have killed herself out of boredom. Her misery and insanity gave her something, which was actually a pretty intriguing concept. Kids can have imagination, sure, but what if you lived in a place where that wasn't enough? What if you had to have an imagination that was so uncontrolled to survive the boredom that it had to become absolute madness?I certainly did find the book exhausting though. Oh my god. I would look at it like a chore I had to do. But then once I was reading it, I'd remember how oddly intrigued I was by the narrator and how spectacularly impressed I was with the writing. It was a give-and-take feeling. If I came home from a long day at work, I'd tell the book to go fuck itself and read something else. Really, that 138 pages felt like 1,000. The novella probably aged me. Coetzee can write though. That dude can seriously spin some words.I don't know how well-developed I'd consider the character of Magda, as her past doesn't often make an appearance (though I really liked the end when she asks her dead father if he remembers her favorite moments on the farm). I would've liked to know more about her childhood, but maybe that would've taken away from the main theme of feeling like goddamn crap. But one of the best moments of the book is when she talks about how happy she was playing with Arthur (page 48). You know every thought she has, sure, but how she came to be her wasn't really there. Then again, maybe who she used to be was always who she is so it didn't matter. I don't know, people. I'm not a fucking scientist.BEST PART OF THE BOOK: My favorite part of the book was only two pages, I think. It's towards the end when the Spanish voices start coming from above. It lasts for a while, but she's still insane when she's dissecting what they mean and how the messages are relevant. However, there's, like, two pages where she starts yelling back and it seems like she's the sanest in that instant because she believes she's refusing the messages. But there's a speech coming from the "sky-gods" and she screams, "Spanish filth!" It was so relieving to see Magda divide herself up into two minds, one crazy and one sane. After spending the entire book in misery and isolation, she comes into her own sanity for a brief moment and refuses the crazy within her and she does it with gusto. It gave me a rather quick instant of awesome hope. I was honestly stoked for her. Her insanity actually cured her madness, I thought! But...it was short-lived.I give this book three stars too because, honestly, Coetzee wrote an entire novella on misery and made it refreshing. However, I can't imagine why I'd ever reread this book unless I was tucked away in a cabin for the winter and wanted to get weird. I enjoyed an in-depth look at a character's constant feelings, but there wasn't too much of a plot for me to get into.RANDOM LINES I FOUND INTRIGUING:"I am not a happy peasant. I am a miserable black virgin, and my story is my story, even if it is a dull black blind stupid miserable story, ignorant of its meaning and of all its many possible untapped happy variants." (page 5) - I thought this sentence summed her up the best, and it was the first instance where I thought, this bitch is gonna be trouble...."whom I would vow to bend to a little lower, slave for a little harder than another woman in the dark, so as not to alarm him, and arouse, if the arts of arousal can be learned, and guide to the right hole, rendered penetrable with a gob of chickenfat from a pot at the bedside, and endure the huffing and puffing of, and be filled eventually, one expects, with seed by, and lie listening to the snoring of, til the balm of slumber arrive." (page 42) - She's as awkward horny as you can get and this description of sex was very...her. It made me feel awful inside."I must not fall asleep in the middle of my life." (page 43) - It's one quiet moment where she admits she's unhappy and wants to be happy in a way that weighs more on the joy than the desolation."The sex is smaller than I thought it would be, almost lost in a bush of black hair straggling up to the navel: a pale boy, a midget, a dwarf, an idiot son who, having survived for years shut away in the cellar, tasting only bread and water, talking to the spiders, singing to himself, is one night dressed in new clothes, set free, made much of, pampered, feasted, and then executed. Poor little thing." (page 69) - I was pretty impressed with this description of a man's junk. This also made me feel terrible.
162`4`What a day to read such a book. Really beautiful writing. He drew me in all the way and I couldn't put it down. Couldn't help thinking about the politics on a day like this but it is so much more than that. It really reveals characters at such a delicate stage in their lives and compels one to read further.
163`3`While this book is disturbing in just its utter bizarreness, it’s an interesting one to study. Good for academics, too weird for “pleasure reading” for me.
164`3`Without any doubt the powerful mastering of the language can be felt in Coetzee’s writing , but I couldn’t help thinking I had not interest in a story where nothing was clear, i.e. is it imagination or reality? As I have understood there is no answer to this question in this short novel. So I just stopped reading it after some pages…
165`4`Written with a furious zeal, J.M. Coetzee tells the tale of Magda, a young woman who is very troubled and is yet burdened with more after her lecherous father dies and leaves her in the company of her married servants. What follows is a tale of madness, lust and power. It is also a tale of race and nation as Coetzee explores the line between black and white in rural South Africa. The prose is maddeningly realistic and the narrative strong and sturdy: In the Heart of the Country finds Coetzee in excellent form. 
166`5`[ where the murder of her father and his new wife is suddenly revealed to be imaginary, when her father walks through the door and back into the narrative; (hide spoiler)]
167`4`gosh, i haven't read any coetzee for ages. he is so brutal. 138 pages long and harrowing.
168`1`i couldn't get it...not my cup of tea...too difficult to follow
169`3`i liked this book.the writing is sharp and spare. the plot is a bit linear and it was easy to see where it was going, but it was done very well
170`null`its a great read, quite short but its deeply analytical of the self, in many ways i think it should be read as a precursor to Disgrace' it explore similar themes from different perspective,the urbane professor vs the farmer's daughter, in many wayss its about belonging and the search of self, its really well written, there are sentences before the burial, during and after-wards which are just excellent, well worth reading, he ties the landscape to the narrative,characters and the plot seamlessly and weaves into the consciousness of the reader, a great ploy that keeps the reader engaged and engrossed, but i preferred 'disgrace' as this is too short and the 'disgrace' fills the gaps that this book demonstrates.
171`3`no.
172`1`this extended tumblr post of a book... it was short, so there's that. Spoilers!   it was all in her mind... or was it? who cares. blegh. 
173`2`too dark for my taste
174`3`well. coetzee plays out his thematic exploration of class, race, and gender dynamics through the unreliable narration of a white woman set to the backdrop of rural south africa. it's often hard to tell what's real here; but they're on a farm and her father is killed and his father's employee - Hendrick, who is black - and his new wife become the farm's new caretakers, while hiding Magda's father's death. And so now Hendrick has power because he knows how to take care of the farm, but Magda has power because she's white, but Hendrick has power because he's a man. These twisted knots result in sexual violence and then a creepy renunciation of the concept of that sexual violence through embracing it; coetzee dives into the emotional trauma of assault while keeping the reader at an arm's distance bc of the high poetic brutality of the hallucinatory narration. it's a good book that is difficult and not enjoyable in any way whatsoever so maybe don't read the god damn thing.
175`3`what's real, what's not..?
176`3`wow, only a south african writer could have produced this! harrowing in a truely mesmirising way. it left me wanting to know more about the author and my country.
177`5`“I am a miserable black virgin, and my story is my story, even if it is a dull stupid blind black miserable story, ignorant of its meaning and of all its many possible untapped happy variations. I am I. Character is fate. History is God. Pique, pique, pique.” So states the tormented but eloquent narrator of J.M. Coetzee’s In the Heart of the Country just as the reader has turned a slim handful of her terrifying tale’s pages. In some ways she is swift and certain in her words as in her brutal acts. In some ways she swaggers in and flaunts the general sense of ignorance that pervades her life. She speaks chilling truths that she claims as her own; meanwhile, a haunting stream of suggestive uncertainties, possibilities, and nebulous forces beyond her awareness and control weaves through her words. Coetzee creates one of those rare, remarkable first-person narrators whose distinct voice will stay with readers long after they’ve finished a book. He also presents a compelling portrait of the politically volatile South African culture in which the novel is set. More broadly, the novel encourages us to contemplate the roles that a wide range of factors—such as social class, gender/sexual identity, and family relationships--play in shaping individual identity. I’m already juggling ideas about teaching this book in college-level literature classes and would recommend it to book clubs and reading circles. It is an engrossing and quick read, displays literary artistry worthy of close critical analysis, and presents a wide range of issues worth talking about. The short novel, which was only Coetzee’s second, exhibits none of the common weaknesses or shortcomings often found in early or minor works by renowned authors, which are often interesting reads simply because they shows signs or stages of the emerging brilliance seen in the author’s masterpieces. On the contrary, it is brilliant in and of itself. A number of critics have compared Coetzee’s mastery of first-person narration and his overall prose style here to Faulkner’s or to Poe’s, and the novel reads like something of a strange stew of Poe, Faulkner, and a narrative consciousness that is distinctly Coetzee’s own. It shares large tracts of common artistic ground with both of the other two Coetzee novels, Disgrace and Diary of a Bad Year, that I’ve read so far. Yet, like each of those two books, it reveals a unique dimension of Coetzee’s imaginative universe. I chose this book over more popular Coetzee picks because I’d heard it compared to Faulkner’s As I Lay Dying, one of my absolute favorite novels, and because it had come up in discussion when I did a presentation on narrators who exhibit behavior considered sociopathic or psychopathic. It turned out to be an excellent choice, on par with the other two. Here, as in both Diary and Disgrace, Coetzee sets up a highly original and thought-provoking artistic challenge for himself. As I felt my way into all three books, I soon found myself asking, “Now how is he going to pull this off?”. Yet he not only triumphs in each of them, but achieves something far beyond my expectations, an affirmation of my faith in the potential possibilities of the contemporary novel. I’d recommend In the Heart of the Country to anyone who has enjoyed one or more of Coetzee’s works, to anyone who particularly enjoys strong first-person narration, and to those who, like me, appreciate high-quality sentence-level writing style. I’d also recommend it to teachers and group leaders looking for a strong classroom or reading group selection to replace an old standby. The only readers I would advise not to read this book are those who dislike works with criminal/mad/deviant/unlikeable narrators/protagonists, those who prefer a conventional narrative structure, and those who are put off by violence or graphic imagery. Otherwise, it’s an absolute gem.
