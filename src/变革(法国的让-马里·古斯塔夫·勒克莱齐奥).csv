1`5`A book that should be read until its last page. From the other comments left here most of them stopped halfway through. It should be read completely to fully understand it (as most books should). Is not an "action-based" book, is more closer to a "sensorial-based" type.
2`4`A character that might as well have been a cousin of Camus' 'The Stranger' goes hypersentive to everything that goes on in hi world; crazy in other words.
3`3`A very dreamy, introspective book. I don't know what to make of it yet, but I do like what I have read so far.
4`4`An excellent read in my opinion. I'm not sure why Le Clezio isn't very popular. The two books of his that I've read have been wonderful.
5`3`At first, I enjoyed reading the book. Then some chapters just got too strange and I thought the book sucked. The ending chapter is great, though, and worth the time I spent to get there. While this book was in my hands it ranged from 2 to 4 stars and ended at 5. Overall, though, I cannot say anything much more than 'I liked it.'
6`3`Beautiful writing, too bad I was bored by it. Sometimes, I wish I was more French.
7`5`Beautifully written and engaging till the end.
8`4`Curious. Can't really say more than that. I'm used to Le Clezio wandering off extensively on descriptions, but not usually so psychologically internal/philosophical as this was.
9`3`Detailed review at Potter's Book Blog: http://pottersbookblog.wordpress.com/
10`3`Falls somewhere between Beckett's early short stories and early Amis. Which is to say I liked it, though it felt "early". Felt like it was supposed to feel like it went on too long, and did.
11`4`First novel by the later Nobel prize winner. Sometimes too ponderous in its ponderings, but often quite intriguing, fluid and inviting. A portrait of madness, maybe?
12`4`Good writing, but I'm not sure I have much of an idea of what went on in this novel.
13`null`Guess I will keep the number of JMG Le Clezio that I read to 1.
14`2`Hated this book. I couldn't finish it despite being a short read. If you like really pretentious books, then it may be for you.
15`3`He did go on talking. Existential nutter or not? Origin of the species or nut? I'm sure when this book was released back in the Beatnik days, it raised a few eyebrows and threw open a few shuttered minds. It covers the usual suspect questions of why we are here with a je ne sais quoi kind of psychotic twist. You may see yourself coming and going.He went on, still talking to himself (but luckily he didn't overdo that, no - partly because he had never been talkative). Ch. 1. 25/27"Adam seemed to be alone in his ability to die whenever he wanted... Ch. 5. 41/48How then, can what IS be going to be in the future. Or how could it come into being? If it came into being; it is not; nor is it if it is going to be in the future. Ch. 5. 26/48Because there always comes a day when one proves to be right in waiting for death. Ch. 5. 26/48The sentry boxes on either side of the entrance (to the zoo) were closed. But as far as the road, almost as far as the sea, despite the general withdrawal of men and beasts, there hovered here and there a vague odour of she-monkey, gently insinuating itself until you began to doubt your own species. Ch.6. 28/28So now as a result, there is a kind of God dwelling in each of them by turns and calling them to Himself, at the hour of his choice, that they may live in what they had never seen before, dead men. Ch.12. 19/19Being ubiquitous, he sometimes passed himself in the street, coming around the corner of a house. Ch. 13. 39/41
16`3`Honestly, I did not know what to make of this book. The world through the eyes of one mentally disturbed fellow for sure--with insights for the "sane" I guess, and some striking parallels to the science of the origin of everything.
17`3`I am a sucker for introspection. This accident report finds its American version in the cartoon Duckman. See: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blppKS...
18`null`I am reading this in English. The title isThe Interrogation in English. It was hisfirst novel published at age 23.
19`null`I bought it because of the uber-cool book cover. He also won the Nobel Prize this year for literature. But again, the book cover looks good and the author is handsome.
20`3`I can honestly say most of this book makes no sense. But I think that might be the point.
21`1`I did not like this book and fell a sleep numerous times while trying to read it. Although I appreciate the fine line between mysticism and craziness with which author tries to get us to see through Adam Pollo's eyes, I thought the way it was done was droll so I give this book a 1.5 stars.The book is about what happens to a man who spends to much time with himself cut off from society. His mind begins to create things in lieu of reality. Adam fears the outside world and the people and things they represent. He tries to separate himself from everyday life in order to take everything he sees in. He likes to passively experience life as a watcher.Adam is a deserter of the military and date raped a friend named Michele. Even though he raped her, Michele is the only connection he has to the outside world including gossip and money.He raised artificial problems and is indecisive. He is overwhelmed by small details of everyday life and he recreates a fictional war due to the lack of external stimuli. He vacillates between hallucinations and clarity in seeing minutiae that other people miss. He has a negative inkling that something bad will happen to him like death. He makes an interesting observation in that both time and existence contain both the finite and the infinite. For time, it can be divided into seconds but at the same time can reach into infinity. Likewise, existence can be divided into packets of ideas but are also capable of replicating in perpetuity. When he meditates, he becomes one with nature and dies feeling what it is like to decompose to distinct pockets of the self. It sounds to me, he describes being one with the universe through the vividness of his interactions with nature.Adam makes himself into an animal seeing the world through the eyes of a dog instead of empathizing with humans. In a drowned man, Adam finds himself seeing himself as a freshly caught fish and the fishermen as monsters who takes the life of the fish.He is squatting in someone else's home and has no direction in his life. He is thinking of various ways to occupy himself while staying aloof from any human interaction. In his unfocused state, Adam is preoccupied by his own imaginations of his violent death.It seems that Adam sixties has faith on the society to take action that eclipses that of any one individual. Adam plays with being infinite by mediating and obliterating the self therefore becoming nothing and everything @ the same time.Adam Pollo is a crazy person who obsesses on an unifying principle of everything in one moment and the next is obsesses with details of everything. He is destroying his stalking Michele while squatting in other people's homes. Again, Adam has a sensation with being one with the cosmos as every atom in his body comingles with the surrounding atoms as well as our creation of technology. Whereas Adam's mother is trying to make her son normal, he is different in the way he is; perhaps this is the reason he ran away from home. His difference in trying to find a unifying theme in humanity is crippling him in his daily living. He eventually became manic and disrupt the order of things.When he started crazily speaking in public, he got institutionalized in a mental hospital. In an interview with students, it came out that Adam likes to be alone and left his parents home to squat in a house on the hill in order to commune with nature because he wants to feel superior to nature. The psychiatrist diagnosed him with Bipolar Disorder type I with psychotic delirium. While Julienne initially thought that Adam was sane, he recounted a story from his youth of a fellow student who wanted to be unified with God by studying his opposite the Devil and eventually get to God but he died in the process when he was in his Devil phase. He explains that it does not make a difference whether the person was made up or was him since everyone experience is his own.Adam tries to explain mysticism in a way that goes beyond the boundaries of analytical explanation which he fails. After trying to make people run away by calling what they are doing to him BS, he is finally alone in his insane asylum where he can contemplate the "mystical unities of life". 
22`1`I don't blame le Clezio for having written this book. At the time he was just a young man struggling to find his voice. To his credit, he would later more or less disown his debut. However, I find it completely inexplicable that the Interrogation once caused a literary sensation. Apparently Michel Foucault went out of his way to praise this dreadful thing? what??The Interrogation was simply one the worst reading experiences I've had in the past few years. I'd read a couple other novels by le Clezio, Terra Amata and Desert, which were both pretty decent, but sadly this book made by far the bigger impression. I told myself it's not long, so I might as well finish it, but it just dragged and dragged over a hellish two weeks. It's not particularly difficult except for being impossibly, unspeakably dull. The "experimental" elements are absurdly tired and derivative. This book is what people are trying to avoid when they use "pretentious" as a slur.(Is this the way all serious literature appears to a philistine?)
23`null`I don't give up on books often but when I do it is because I am utterly bored, which is what happened with "The Interrogation".
24`1`I have no idea why this book won Prix Renaudot in 1963. I don't want to spoil but it's is a bad parody of L'Etranger by Albert Camus. If you read it, you will find a lot of parallels and Le Cl√©zio seemed to copy Camus' writing style in my opinion.It was hard for me to follow the events because there's actually no plot (roman-puzzle). The book only follows the protagonist's thoughts, which are really messy. Plus, I detest it due to the rape right at the beginning. Unbelievable.
25`3`I have to confess to not getting this book. Was it to post-modern? Too French? Too philosophical/turned meta-physical? They sort of all merged into one. The book takes a major turn 3/4 of the way through and after the turn, I sort of wish I'd read the first part a bit more carefully.I continue to think highly of Le Clezio and enjoy his style and language, but at times wonder if I'm not up to speed for modern literature, or if the whole literary world is duped.
26`3`I liked this book but had a hard time keeping reading it because the main character Adam Pollo can be hard to follow and because the book basically has no plot. The idea is that you don't know whether Adam was recently released from an insane asylum or whether he deserted the military. I voted for the insane asylum early on. The interrogation the book is named after doesn't occur until the very last part of the book, which is sad because it is one of the more interesting parts.
27`2`I love it when an author inadvertently sums up his own book somewhere along the way:"You don't see that the man who wrote "the earth is blue like an orange" is a lunatic or a fool? -- Of course not, you say to yourself there's a genius, he's dislocated reality in a couple of words." Whoever decided to give this guy a Nobel Prize for this book decided that he was a genius for the same reason. I'm more inclined to the "lunatic or a fool" camp. I'm afraid I like my books to have a story, and this one didn't. I found it pretentious and boring. I kept waiting for something to happen and nothing ever did. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that the author is technically gifted. And the last chapter did finally pull me in. But overall, I'm just glad I got through it.
28`4`I must say I find this book very french and very 60s. Not a bad thing mind you. Clearly copied by many others after. Easy to see why it won such a prestigious prize, especially by one so young. I recently watched Fando Y Lis which came out a couple of years or so later. Although different they held similarities for me in that they both are examples of the type of experimentalism in film and literature that was popularized in the 60s and 70s. Clearly the protagonist is insane but the world is shown to be as well. I believe if I had read this book when I was still in my 20s I would have given it 5 stars but the constant digressions and almost excruciating detail wore on me at times. I've become accustomed to the mad world we live in you see. 
29`4`I read this book aloud from the translation by Daphne Woodward. In French, the title " proc√®s-verbal" is more accurate and more broadly evocative than 'Interrogation.' A 'proc√®s-verbal' may refer the minutes of a meeting, such as the meeting some psychiatry students hold to question the protagonist in the last third of the book, but it may all so refer to a summary of the facts in a criminal case, which is what the whole book is.On the surface, this is the story of a mentally disturbed young man who gradually slips from life squatting in a house in a southern French resort town where he is involved in something resembling a relationship with a girl, through progressively more bizarre actions and harangues to confinement in a mental hospital. At least for me, the young man in his self-centered state is initially unattractive. His ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù‚Äì at least she lends him money and is willing to have sex with him ‚Äì he treats rather badly not only out of indifference and self-preoccupation but also out of a sort of misdirected inner rage. But as his struggles continue he becomes ever more sympathetic and engaging until at the end he is an eloquent spokesman for a view of reality.The turning point in my feelings about the protagonist is a section where he joins the crowd around the body of a drowned man that has recently been hauled from the sea. There is some really remarkable writing in this part of the book, which portrays in prose appropriate to each subject the reactions of the bystanders, the physical reality of the waterlogged corpse, the highly textured reality of the shale beach, the stereotyped life of the drowned man and his family, and other matters. Writing in this book often shows this sort of flexibility; there is effective writing of many sorts: descriptions of nature, descriptions of mental states, description of animals, and descriptions of the nature of reality from a certain perspective. Part of the novel is epistilatory, consisting of letters written to the girlfriend, if not delivered to her.What is this perspective? What is his struggle about? Our protagonist is very well educated. He occasionally refers to a number of obscure writers including Manilius, a little-known and difficult Latin poet who wrote about astronomy, the Catholic mystic Jan van Ruysbroek, who inclined towards pantheism, and the pre-Socratic philosopher Parmenides. For me, because his thought intrigues me, Parmenides was the clue. Saying almost anything about Parmenides is a controversial oversimplification (http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/par...), but, granting that, Parmenides' subject is the elaboration of the relationship between the unity and diversity of things. This is the protagonist's struggle, to order and elaborate the relationship between diversity and unity in the broadest sense. That is the reason for the different, detailed descriptions of reality from different perspectives. It appears in his view of the pebbly beach, of the diversity of the crowd looking at the drowned man, in the process of the breakdown of the drowned man's body, which is devolving into components but is still a single thing, in his identification with animals in zoo, is what he is struggling with when his haranguing the crowd with a speech that eventually gets him committed, is what he is trying to tell the students about, and to tell them that understanding the unity in diversity is more important than understanding whether he is mad or not.
30`4`I was recently told that men typically write introspectively and that women write outwardly about the world around them: if this is the case then I am ashamed to say that I particularly like very masculine books and this is one of them.This is Le Cl√©zio's first novel and it feels that way but does anyone ever really get tired of poetic, introspective, observations about time, memory and death - Particularly death. The word death must be one of the most used words in this book which is something I found oddly comforting.basically the book reads like Hesse or Mann, the prose is in places incredible, highly recommended.
31`1`I wish I hadn't taken the time to finish this. It was a long stream of scattered consciousness. Trigger warning for scenes of rape, violence, and descriptions of dead individuals.
32`2`I'm crushed by the weight of my consciousness. I'm dying of it, that's a fact.
33`5`I'm not sure if anyone is going to be swayed by my saying this, but either way: Read This! Seriously. I know that the Nobel committee are a bunch of stodgy pretentious American hating bastards, but in this instance, they really got it right. There's not much that I can actually say about the book because there isn't a great deal that occurs, but never has nothing happening been described so perfectly. It's not a nothing happens in the "Seinfeld sense" either. It's more of a nothing happens in the dude spends 10 pages killing a rat, 5 pages describing a room, 20 pages following a dog that ultimately fornicates in a store, and so forth. A 23 year old writing a publishable book in general is amazing. A 23 year old publishing one About (nearly) Nothing that has more nuance and depth than 99.999% of what is out there while managing to impart amazing truths at a breakneck speed is simply astonishing. All the same. Seriously: Read This!
34`3`I've frequently seen this book criticised for not being an accurate depiction of mental illness, which is just unfortunate because it's not about mental illness; Adam Pollo, apart from suffering from some memory loss and quite possibly a hint of PTSD, is not a mentally disturbed man, at least not in a clinical sense. What The Interrogation is about is disillusion, isolation and estrangement from human society, and as such it's (occasionally) doing a good job.And now to what's wrong with it.It seems fairly obvious to me that Le Cl√©zio ran out of steam with the core idea about halfway through the process of writing it and instead began filling the book out with needless experimentation loosely surrounding the plot, which doesn't really work because it's not really that type of book. I don't know if it was the author's youth or pressure from the publishers or why it was insisted that The Interrogation must necessarily be a full length novel, but it would have worked a lot better as a novella. 
35`null`If you weren't having an existential crisis when you start, you will be when you finish.
36`3`In the Introduction, Le Clezio states that The Interrogation ‚Äúis the story of a man who is not sure whether he has just left the army or a mental home. In other words, I deliberately chose, at the outset, a tenuous, abstract theme.‚Äù He is correct. The book is certainly interesting. The question for the reader, with such a scattered protagonist and narrator, is what is reality. Everything is suspenseful, and the reader must question whether the absurdities are real, are the actions of the characters real, do we even know when and where we are? Finally Le Clezio shows us the newspaper, which clearly indicates that Adam is, at least in the opinion of society, deranged. There are some very beautiful passages along the way. For instance, in the discussion of war, Adam states, ‚ÄúBut one gets used to it‚Äîthere‚Äôs nothing one gets used to as easily as war. There‚Äôs no such thing as war. People die every day, and so what? War is all or nothing. War is total and permanent. I, Adam, I‚Äôm still in it, come to that. I don‚Äôt want to get out of it.‚Äù (42) Is Adam making a choice to live this way? Does he see himself engaged in an ongoing conflict that he actually prefers? ‚ÄúIn other words, time includes both the finite and the infinite, the measurable and the incommensurable; which is a contradiction and therefore a logical absurdity.‚Äù (47) Can he be two places at once? There is a logical breakdown in Adam‚Äôs mind. When faced with such a paradox, what should his reaction be? ‚ÄúAnd suddenly he stood up; he had turned into fear itself, been transformed into danger-for-white rats; his head was full, now, of something that was no longer anger or disgust or any form of cruelty, but a kind of obligation to kill.‚Äù (85) Clearly, danger is coming. As it becomes clear that Adam is, in fact, mad, are we witnessing a tragedy? What form will it take? ‚ÄúHe was happy to be living in a scale model of the universe, all his own, a gentle place with a thousand different ploys to occupy it.‚Äù (104) ‚ÄúI had a kind of sick taste on my tongue. It was very hot, and everything felt clammy. I remember tearing a page out of the exercise-book and writing in the idle of it:Interrogation concerning a disaster among the ants.‚Äù (167)Those quotes represent my summary of this novel.
37`3`Initially intoxicating, the writing suffused with a visionary apprehension of the world, like a Van Gogh world everywhere seething and alive and teetering on madness, but then it kind of let me down toward the end as it wrapped itself too neatly up and strove for "significance". And maybe one or two too many lit tricks, but still a powerful book.
38`3`It should have started from the interview and then backwards. The chronological order does not help you to really grasp the psychological problems Adam had and it makes the book not understandable at points. However, if you omit many pages, it was very beautiful and funny at times.
39`4`It took a while to really get into, but worth the effort. Certainly not a "novel" in the traditional sense of the word. Very psychological and tests the fine line society has drawn between brilliance and insanity.
40`3`It's like reading an endless dream: things are slow, disjointed, and don't always make sense. There's mystery, and things happen to this man that probably aren't true. Of note, I did have to almost force myself to stick with it as I'm used to a much faster pace. Yet you can see the beauty of his writing when you take time to appreciate his subtlety.
41`4`I‚Äôll be thinking about this one for a long time!
42`3`I‚Äôm not sure I remember what led me to this book. I think I was looking up ‚Äúgreat contemporary French writers,‚Äù and Le Cl√©zio came up. Anyway, the premise sounded good: a loner and squatter has an existential crisis and is interrogated. The problem was that the interrogation, which happens only at the very end of the novel, reveals little about the actions of the main character, Adam, that occurred in the previous 110 pages. References to Adam as the first man (or the last) abound, as in the chapter where he visits the zoo. The book is heady, filled with references you won‚Äôt bother looking up, and I think it just results in the same point as Sartre: hell is other people. Adam is intelligent but isn‚Äôt completely likable; he‚Äôs lazy, moody, easily brought to violence. So it is difficult to sympathize with him throughout the book. Maybe it‚Äôs not necessary to sympathize with the main character in a book, but it helps, especially when they are stupendously flawed. It was first published in 1963, and the story does paint a lush picture of a seaside French town in that period. Adam trying to make a phone call in a bar using a sort-of two-way caller is a thing of a bygone age. But it‚Äôs never really clear who is telling us this story (the narrator refers to themselves as ‚ÄúI‚Äù only once, at the end), why the chapters are organized by letters, why the alphabet chapters are never finished, why some characters are introduced and not followed (including the dog), nor are we given any real insight into Adam‚Äôs breakdown. Some elements of the story might be interesting to analyze (the ever presence of water, references to drowning, the death of the rat, etc.) but I was not invested enough in the book to do that thinking.
43`4`J.M.G. Le Clezio's The Interrogation begins like a French beatnik novel. We are in a Riviera resort town looking through the eyes of one Adam Pollo, a squatter living in a vacation home. He smokes, reads newspapers and magazines, works on his suntan, and occasionally gets together with his girlfriend Michelle, from whom he borrows money from time to time.After a while, the relationship goes bad, and Adam becomes more frenzied as the weather changes from summer to winter. He breaks down at one point, ranting at a crowd, until he is picked up and moved to a mental hospital for examination.Suddenly, the merely phenomenological Adam Pollo we had known before becomes an intellectual familiar with Ruysbroek, the Inca, and a whole slew of mystics and philosophers. This is during an interrogation by a psychiatry professor and his young students, who bring out a showy response from him.The Interrogation is Le Clezio's first novel, which becomes ever more interesting as we see Adam developing into ... what? Note to Self: Read Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest for possible comparison.
44`4`Le Clezio achieves what I wished I had a couple years ago (I was too maudlin, more or less, and more influenced by sci-fin/fantasy genre-fiction than detective). Brilliant, a novel of youth. But very French.
45`3`Le Clezio is the 2008 winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature. This was his first novel, written in 1963; if I hadn't known when it was written, I could have placed it to within five years. It is very existentialist, heavily influenced by Sartre's La nausee, the nouvelle roman, and Salinger's Catcher in the Rye. The first two-thirds of the book has no real plot, and only one real character; the episodes (if one can even call them that) are totally random, and may or may not be connected with the character; the descriptions are very detailed and concrete, but entirely phenomenological, not to say bizarre. The point seems to be that reality does not parcel out into narratives, or fit into categories. The last third is different, with more connected narrative. This was a book that at times I liked very much, and at other times I just found very annoying. I don't think I would want to read a lot in this style.
46`null`One of the Worst Novelists to win the Nobel PrizeAfter Bob Dylan's Nobel Prize there has been a lot of writing about writers who were never awarded the Nobel, and about how political the prize has often been. It's also illuminating to consider writers will have gotten the prize but haven't stood the test of time. There have been some astonishingly poor choices over the years. This book, and this author, are irredeemably poor. If you think this is an expressive conjuring of the mental state of a disturbed young man, if you think this is a fair representation of tortured imagination, you should read Schreber's "Memoirs of My Mental Illness," or Artaud, or Genet, or Burroughs, or anyone! Read Emil Nolde's Memoirs, read something by A.L. Kennedy, read anything! Le Clezio writes whatever comes into his head at any moment. There are some sustained passages in which he is imagining something from one point of view, as one experience -- there's a chapter about a rat, and one about a dead man washed up on a beach -- but he continuously interrupts himself with random notions, names, places, and ideas. He seems to think this is how novels work, and he may also think this is how abnormal mental states feel. It is childish, in the bad sense of that word.And the Nobel Prize: clearly, it is evidence that for some people, this kind of scattered, adventitious, random, opportunistic bricolage is an adequate representation of states of consciousness. Such people have apparently never experienced real depths of imagination. It is tremendously sad to think of that.
47`3`Plucked at random after a wander through the library stacks, this one, well, it was more than a little challenging. The protagonist more or less just wanders around doing increasingly unstable things, which are described in lyric, faintly fevered prose. Not terrible, and actually quite evocative on occasion, even in translation. It's easy to see how this might have floated the boat of certain folks back in the early 1960s...particularly in the original French.Still. Not exactly a page turner.
48`1`Pretentious and confusing, Le Clezio jumps from thought to thought occasionally adding philosophical jargon that leaves you disoriented. For a Nobel winner, I only hope it's because of a poor French to English translation.
49`4`Read it in Swedish about 1970. Didn't understand much but fell in love with the author (platonical). Later he was awarded the Noble prize in literature!
50`1`Ridiculous. Flap summary very misleading. Characters are not likable.
51`null`So this was apparently the thing that turned the French literary establishment onto a young Le Clezio. Which, to a certain degree, makes sense, it's the sort of thing the French literary establishment likes, which is to say its form is quasi-experimental, even if its content is dully predictable, it takes an ironic attitude, but you're not sure what this ironic attitude is toward (and if you have to ask, you're clearly not worthy of it), and things happen with the same stochasticity that Godard employed in Pierrot le Fou.Urgh. I quite liked Le Clezio's Desert. But it's shit like this that makes me resent the '60s generation even more. The wacky sensibilities of the time have aged horribly, and they've stoked the fires of late-stage capitalism ever since.
52`3`Starts with with some wonderfully tactile passages as the story opens in a young man's hideaway in a beach house on a hill, description so thick it feels like a Wes Anderson movie. Adam Pollo is a young man seeking solitude who sees the world in strange and colourful ways. He is antisocial to the point of isolation. He has a relationship with a girl via letters and one visit to his house on the hill the nature of which is never revealed, platonic or otherwise. Among the bizarre, childlike set pieces there is his murder of a rat with some billard balls and his stalking a dog all the way into town.Unfortunately the second half of the book, the titular Interrogation, in pretentious and downright confusing. Adam stalks Michele a while, gets into a fight with an American, preachers on the street and finally ends up in a mental hospital to conclude with some mindless intellectual debates with some medical students. THe novel concludes with Adam's strangely geometrical contentedness. A cool character, some stunning passages of writing that stand alone, but let down by an incomprehensible final stretch. 5
53`2`THis is a pretentious quasi experimental novel done better by other writers of his generation. Not without interest in first hundred pages but sags under the weight of it's smug, conflated narritive vocue and technique. I sincerely hope his books gets better as his career progresses considering he won the Nobel for Literature.
54`3`The Interrogation aka Le Proces Verbal by J.M.G. Le ClezioInteresting and amazing positive transformation, if not as excellent on a second reading as it was for the first - 7 out of 10This book has placed me in an awkward position.Normally, one should be able to enjoy better one work after the passing of years has added wisdom, perspective and more understanding.Well, the opposite has happened in the case of The Interrogation, with a first elating reading, followed by a recent rather disappointing encounter.We could argue that there are two different readers, considering the statement of Proust that we become various people over the years. When I first read Le Clezio I thought him South American for some weird reason.Now that he has won the Nobel Prize in the meantime, I have discovered my mistake and thought about reading one of his famous novels.The lack of patience which may have affected the first engagement with The Interrogation had made room for a similar tendency to disengage when a work is not to my liking.It is true that I remember even the first reading to have been surprising and rewarded only by the epiphany of the hero.I was awed by his positive transformation of Adam Pollo- the main, if not the only relevant personage in the book.Otherwise, it was intriguing and maybe even annoying on the first reading ‚Äì although I have to say I only speculate, for I do not recall this aspect-to read a large part of the book where nothing much happens to send your heart racing.Yes, Adam follows a dog for days and you may find that amusing, interesting, but hardly inspirational- is it?There are some horrifying aspects, for a squeamish guy like the undersigned- with rats squashed and killed with billiard balls.Since this work is so highly appreciated, my comments would not diminish it and neither are they intended to do so.They just point out the limits to my comprehension and the break, even the abyss that exists between the world I live in and the fantasies of Adam Pollo.There are moments when I felt sorry for him- I guess‚Ä¶But it is not out of order to consider the opposite situation where I am to be pitied for my lack of imagination.After all, for the entire dog act that he puts, Adam does experience some extraordinary transformations and hallucinating he comes to realms I will never visit.Alas‚Ä¶The highlight and Supreme Moment of bliss comes when Adam sees an old person struggling to move ahead.This is when he has the Peak Experience and he is in the zone or Flow- there is a classic psychology book called Flow.That is how I remember my first elation upon reading this work--	After beating about the bush and following a dog like a mindless quadruped, Adam Pollo reaches his zenith.The Meaning of life appears clear to him, together with the greatness of the human being, exemplified paradoxically by an incapacitated old man ‚Äì or woman- I cannot remember.
55`1`The Nobel for Le Clezio makes me think that the Swedish Academy must be like a legislative body ‚Äì it produces odd compromises that are no one's first choice. My only previous experience with Le Clezio was a rather gauzy commentary on the conquest of Mexico, a topic about which much has already been written, with great specificity. So I approached ‚Äúthe Investigation‚Äù with curiosity and a dash of hope, especially since it took the Renaudot Prize. The main character, Adam Pollo, does not know if he has been released from the Army or the mental hospital. Le Clezio settles that point during the narrative: Pollo seems detached from the norms of society, has occasional outbursts, some of them violent. His mind focuses on extraneous minutiae. Near the beginning, Pollo commits what can only be described as rape, but the victim has no reaction. But he seems rootless and detached. There are interesting moments toward the end, when Le Clezio does some interesting things with form, recording a psychiatric evaluation and introducing mock ups of newspapers into the text. But in the end, Pollo and his world seem not so much surreal as deliberately unreal. Perhaps this is all a reflection of Pollo‚Äôs confused mind. But the narrative thread is weak to start with and can‚Äôt stand that strain. I don‚Äôt mind unreliable narrators, but unreliable writers leave me cold.
56`1`The closing words: ‚ÄúWhile awaiting the worst, the story is over. But wait. You‚Äôll see. I (please note I haven‚Äôt used that word too often) think we can count on them. It would be really strange if one of these days there were not something more to say about Adam or some other among him.‚ÄùBut first, let's hope for recovery for the author and his protagonist from their aphasia.
57`2`There is no telling what you might come up with if you poke around long enough in a used bookstore. This is a sort of existentialist novel whose author J.M.G. Le Clezio won a Nobel Prize in 2008. The Interrogation was published 45 years before that and was his first work.This is the story of Adam Pollo, a deserter who figures he has conquered the task of living without money. To that end he takes up occupancy in an abandoned house. His most notable physical skill is the ability to sit or lie perfectly still without moving a muscle for hours. This he describes as the first stage of anti-existence.Professing to have rejected the concept of living with other people Adam thinks of ways to keep others from approaching him, like picking his teeth with a pocket knife. He passes his days by following a dog about town. His one adventure involves killing a mouse with billiard balls.Adam maintains something of a journal that is written as a series of Dear Michele letters. Michele does indeed exist. Apparently Adam forced himself on her at some point and yet she visits him (once) and lends him money. That is until she comes up with an American boyfriend who beats the crap out of him.As you might expect things go south for Adam as this story goes on. In his forward, the author suggests this work might be "too serious, too mannered and wordy." I tend to agree. I have to admit my attention span wavered a little reading this one.
58`2`There were moments of great writing but overall this was quite pretentious, which makes sense when you consider the writer was in his early 20s when he wrote it. I can see why people enjoyed it at the time of its publication but I don't think it has aged well.
59`null`There‚Äôs a lot to admire about this novel. But LC‚Äôs protagonist gets increasingly annoying. He‚Äôs a complete loser or lunatic, or both, who wanders around, has a sort of girlfriend (and a sort of dogfriend), and that‚Äôs pretty much it. The pace is like a slow French film, but with little dialogue, and the dialogue is pseudo-meaningful in that 50s French way. Thus although singular, it also feels much the same thing. I stopped halfway through.
60`2`This book would best be represented by the cliched stereotype of a Frenchmen: Pretentious, cigarrete smoking, existentialist, wine-drinking philosopher. With a bit of a rapey vibe mixed in. Le Clezio is clearly a capable author, there are a few lines throughout the book that were truly poetic and towards the end when the protagonist is speaking with the students the book picked up a bit. Overall could not say I enjoyed it, and I imagine it takes a special personality to appreciate the book.
61`2`This is a look inside the head of a crazy man, who I suppose Clezio wants to show might not be so crazy after all. Is sanity a relative thing? Are our values? While his descriptions are really nice, working through the impressions they impart, I found they went on too long at certain parts. So much of the novel was getting inside the kid's head with little actual plot, that I found myself getting bored. In some respects, I found myself reminded of The Stranger, although that book is much tighter and more effective.
62`1`This is one of those books that has to be better in French. I've read a lot of Le Clezio in French and they all totally blew me away. The vision and depth he has for scenery and characters is truly breathtaking...at least in French Maybe this is a horrible translation because as far as I can tell the book is about a soldier living in an abandoned house after either a mental breakdown or deserting the army....or both. And his obsession with a local girl, Michele, makes very little sense. I really want to blame the translation here, and I'd be willing to take another crack at this book if the other book had a better translation. This book has horrible grammatical errors, and what seem like word for word translations of French expressions and slang that just don't make sense in English.In English this book is a definite pass. 
63`3`This novel is an internal adventure for a solitary man - Adam.
64`3`To over-describe is to defamiliarize the reader with the thing described. (Conversely, to under-describe can allow the reader more cognitive room to fill in the blanks.) Done well, as here early on, over-description sets the reader squirming. The effect is a little like chalk misapplied to a blackboard. See Russian Formalism. There‚Äôs a fine example of the technique early in Charlotte Bronte‚Äôs Villette, when a painting in a gallery is described. The protagonist here may be mad, so his hyper vigilance to setting, atmosphere, his and others‚Äô bodies, grates even when softened by way of third-person narration. It‚Äôs an admirable way to begin.Adam watched them absentmindedly as though they, their noise and movement, had no logical connection with himself; and every sensation of his overwrought body, which magnified details, fashioned his being into a monstrous object, a compact of pain, in which consciousness of life was merely consciousness of matter through the nerves. (p.14)Adam has avoided working life, the rat race, it appears, so he might indulge himself in a constant welter of sensory, phenomenological experience. He‚Äôs drunk on his sensations. Thus, the use of defamiliarization. It occurs to me that this is very much a young man‚Äôs novel, filled with the knowledge gleaned in college, and marked by a shrewd talent that allows the author to place a few of these ideas in juxtaposition, which in turn function as a clever narrative engine. Impressive. Adam‚Äôs sensibility is wholly solipsistic. He‚Äôs alienated from the social so that he is incapable of giving, so busy is he greedily sucking up bodily sensations. He‚Äôs cruel to animals as all true dyed in the wool serial killers are. He‚Äôs just ruthlessly fucked a young woman; she hasn‚Äôt been seen since; did he kill her? Adam, in short, is a bore, but the prose is not.The novel reminds me of Lolita in this sense, it‚Äôs the story of an obnoxious figure whose prose seeks to be of such overwhelming interest that we excuse, forget, overlook the character‚Äôs loathsomeness. Humbert Humbert‚Äôs was a libertine, greedy for illicit sexual pleasures, self-satisfactions, for humiliating others as a means ego inflation, and for skirting the law. That‚Äôs all here in The Interrogation, though Adam‚Äôs greed is for a deep form of internalized experience.What drives Adam is reflection, lucid meditation. Starting from his own human flesh, from the sum of his present sensations, he annihilates himself by a dual system of multiplication and identification. (p. 154)As the book crawls to its finish, Adam disappears and the novel fragments into a number of discreet stories: the drowned man, the woman in the photographic negative, etc. Then we flashback to Adam at age 12, and move on to a turgid bit of pataphysics. A favorite sentence: ‚ÄúAll the components of the telephone are present in the rhinoceros.‚Äù (p. 153) The device of a torn up notebook is used, written in at some point by grownup Adam, thus the text is even further fragmented. Eventually Adam evolves, perhaps inevitably, from squatter and general cynic to ebullient street-corner prophet. There are many ways to go insane on the page. Two of my favorites are Elena Ferrante‚Äôs The Days of Abandonment and Alberto Moravia‚Äôs Contempt. The Interrogation isn‚Äôt on that exalted level, but it holds the reader and stays lodged in memory. That is a difficult task for any writer. Recommended.
65`4`Visionary MadnessJ. M. G. Le Cl√©zio, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 2008, sprang to international acclaim in 1963 with this visionary novel, published when he was only 23. Fragmented, enigmatic, and obsessive, it is utterly different from his more recent masterpieces such as .Onitsha. and Wandering Star. And yet how could one not be drawn to an author who opens with a self-deprecating preface in which he apologizes for the book in hand, and promises to do better next time, perhaps with something in the manner of Conan Doyle?! There is a lightness and humor about the entire book, no matter how abstruse it may get in its philosophy, that kept me reading eagerly and with a smile.The principal character, Adam Pollo, is an educated man of about 30 whom we see squatting in an empty house above a French seaside town, making occasional forays for "fags, beer, chocolate, stuff to eat" and to take a look around. He is unsure whether he has deserted from the army or escaped from a mental hospital. He writes obsessively in a notebook in the form of letters to Mich√®le, a young woman who visits him early in the book, despite the fact that he virtually raped her some time before. He follows a black dog around the town. He gets into meaningless conversations with strangers, or overhears scraps of dialogue and has them pullulate in his mind. But most of the time he thinks, with a visionary intensity that is extraordinary.A friend remarked that the isolated young man in the seaside town may be a reflection of the title character in Camus' .The Stranger. (1942). I myself picked up echoes of the nouveau roman movement of the 1950s in the occasional exhaustive listing of physical objects. The Interrogation indeed owes a lot to the French avant-garde literature that preceded it, but unlike Camus' protagonist who cannot feel, Adam feels too much. He has an extraordinary power to penetrate the objects and life around him, involving himself totally in the self-immolation of insects sizzling in his candle-flame, or seeing the sun as:‚Ä¶an immense golden spider, its rays covering the sky like tentacles, some twisting, others forming a huge W, clinging to projections in the ground, to every escarpment, at fixed points. All the other tentacles were undulating slowly, lazily, dividing into branches, separating into countless ramifications, splitting open and immediately closing up again, waving to and fro like seaweed.Adam's vision, like the author's, is that of a writer. In the middle of the book, he joins a crowd around the body of a drowned man who has been fished from the sea. He goes on to imagine the conversation of the other bystanders: "And of course (since he who writes is shaping a destiny for himself), they little by little become one with those who drowned the chap." This leads to a string of other disconnected stories about people we never see. Later still, he receives a letter from his mother begging him to come back home; she too has made up a narrative about her son in order to contain and control him, or come to grips with his defection. We all live by stories, but stories can also unmake and destroy us. Fragments of novels, newspapers, poems, and printed signs litter the novel like debris. In one chapter, Adam goes from caf√© to caf√© searching for Mich√®le, only to end up in lists of places from a gazetteer or names from a book index:It was among them that he should have hunted. Then he'd have found everything, including Mich√®le seated at dawn in a deck-chair, cold and wet with dew, shivering amid these interwoven forces.In the end, Adam's tendency to see every tiny piece of his environment as a part of the entire universe‚Äîand also as part of the totality of history, past, present, and future‚Äîreduces him, as an individual, to nothing. He begins to harangue bystanders on the promenade and is arrested and hospitalized. There, he is interviewed by a group of medical students (the Interrogation of the title), but they can do little to penetrate his isolation and completeness. He is alone. He is content.
66`4`gorgeous and slow. do not read if you are impatient, or love hard plot lines. the pace of this pressure cooker may wear on modern Americans (not a judgement, just an observation).
